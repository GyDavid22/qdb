Polymorphism is briefly described as "one interface, many
implementations". Polymorphism is a characteristic of being able to
assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts
-- specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or
an object to have more than one form. There are two types of
polymorphism:

-   Compile time polymorphism

-   Run time polymorphism

Compile time polymorphism is method overloading whereas Runtime time
polymorphism is done using inheritance and interface.
