The best way to inject dependencies in an application is through
constructor injection. Constructor injection involves passing
dependencies as parameters to a class's constructor. Here are the
reasons why constructor injection is considered the best approach:

-   Explicit dependencies: Constructor injection makes dependencies
explicit, as they are clearly defined as constructor parameters.
This improves code readability and makes it easier to understand the
class's dependencies.

-   Compile-time safety: With constructor injection, dependencies are
resolved at compile-time rather than runtime. This allows for early
detection of missing or incorrect dependencies, reducing the chances
of runtime errors.

-   Testability: Constructor injection facilitates easy testing of
classes by allowing for the injection of mock or stub dependencies
during unit testing. By providing test doubles through the
constructor, you can isolate the class under test and verify its
behavior without relying on real dependencies.

-   Immutability: Constructor injection promotes immutability as
dependencies can be declared as final or read-only. Immutable
objects are generally easier to reason about and less prone to bugs
related to state changes.

-   Dependency inversion principle: Constructor injection adheres to the
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) of the SOLID principles. DIP
states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level
modules, but both should depend on abstractions. Constructor
injection allows for the injection of abstractions rather than
concrete implementations, enabling flexibility and loose coupling
between classes.

While other dependency injection techniques like setter injection and
field injection exist, they have certain drawbacks compared to
constructor injection. Setter injection can lead to optional
dependencies or unexpected null values, while field injection tightly
couples classes and makes it harder to identify dependencies. Hence,
constructor injection is generally recommended as the best way to inject
dependencies.
