The Reader/Writer class hierarchy is character-oriented, and the
InputStream/OutputStream class hierarchy is byte-oriented. The
ByteStream classes are used to perform input-output of 8-bit bytes
whereas the CharacterStream classes are used to perform the input/output
for the 16-bit Unicode system. There are many classes in the ByteStream
class hierarchy, but the most frequently used classes are
FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. The most frequently used classes
CharacterStream class hierarchy is FileReader and FileWriter.
