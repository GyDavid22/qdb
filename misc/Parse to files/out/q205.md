Output:

Person class constructor called

Employee class constructor called

Explanation:

The super() is implicitly invoked by the compiler if no super() or
this() is included explicitly within the derived class constructor.
Therefore, in this case, The Person class constructor is called first
and then the Employee class constructor is called.
