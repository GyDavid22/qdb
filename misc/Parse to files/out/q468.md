Java doesn't use pointers because they are unsafe and increases the
complexity of the program. Since, Java is known for its simplicity of
code, adding the concept of pointers will be contradicting. Moreover,
since JVM is responsible for implicit memory allocation, thus in order
to avoid direct access to memory by the user, pointers are discouraged
in Java.
