Consider the example where we have an ArrayList of employees like( EId,
Ename, Salary), etc. Now if we want to sort this list of employees based
on the names of employees. Then that is not possible to sort using the
Collections.sort() method. We need to provide something to the sort()
function depending on what values we have to perform sorting. Then in
that case a comparator is used.

A comparator is an interface, which makes it possible to compare two
objects, mostly used for sorting.
