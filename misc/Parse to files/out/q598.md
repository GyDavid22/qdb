In terms of writing code, both will be of same complexity because
synchronization code is independent of a number of threads. Choice of
synchronization though depends upon a number of threads because the
number of thread present more contention, so you go for advanced
synchronization technique e.g. lock stripping, which requires more
complex code and expertise.
