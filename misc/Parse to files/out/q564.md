The factorial of an integer is calculated by multiplying all the numbers
from 1 to the given number:

F(n) = F(1)\*F(2)\...F(n-1)\*F(n)

The following example code shows how to use recursion to find the
factorial of an integer:

public static long factorial(long n) {

>if (n == 1)

>>return 1;

>else

>>return (n \* factorial(n - 1));

}
