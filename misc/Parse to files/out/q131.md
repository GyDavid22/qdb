There are a total of 3 different types of priority available in Java.

-   MIN_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 1.

-   MAX_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 10.

-   NORM_PRIORITY: It has an integer value assigned with 5.

In Java, Thread with MAX_PRIORITY gets the first chance to execute. But
the default priority for any thread is NORM_PRIORITY assigned by JVM.
Also, besides these predefined values, assigning a number between 1 and
10 by hand as a priority will also work.
