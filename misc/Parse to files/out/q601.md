Busy spin is one of the technique to wait for events without releasing
CPU. It's often done to avoid losing data in CPU cached which is lost
if the thread is paused and resumed in some other core. So, if you are
working on low latency system where your order processing thread
currently doesn't have any order, instead of sleeping or calling
wait(), you can just loop and then again check the queue for new
messages.

It's only beneficial if you need to wait for a very small amount of
time e.g. in microseconds or nanoseconds. LMAX Disrupter framework, a
high-performance inter-thread messaging library has a
BusySpinWaitStrategy which is based on this concept and uses a busy spin
loop for EventProcessors waiting on the barrier.
