Here are some best practices you can follow while overloading a method
in Java to avoid confusion with auto-boxing:

-   Don't overload method where one accepts int and other accepts
Integer.

-   Don't overload method where number of argument is same and only
order of argument is different.

-   Use varargs after overloaded methods has more than 5 arguments.
