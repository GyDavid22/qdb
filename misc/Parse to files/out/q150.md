The above program will give a compile-time error. The compiler will
throw 2 errors in this.

-   \[Illegal Combination of modifiers: abstract and final\] at line 1.

-   \[Cannot inherit from final 'InterviewBit'\] at line 4.

It is because abstract classes are incomplete classes that need to be
inherited for making their concrete classes. And on the other hand, the
final keywords in class are used for avoiding inheritance. So these
combinations are not allowed in Java.
