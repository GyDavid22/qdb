The output of the above program will be Hello. Main Method. This is
because JVM will always call the main method based on the definition it
already has. Doesn't matter how many main methods we overload it will
only execute one main method based on its declaration in JVM. The main
method JVM starts is always the public static void one, with only a
String\[\] object as a parameter.
