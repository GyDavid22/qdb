Exceptions are runtime errors. Suppose we are making an android
application with java. And it all works fine but there is an exceptional
case when the application tries to get the file from storage and the
file doesn't exist (This is the case of exception in java). And if this
case is not handled properly then the application will crash. This will
be a bad experience for users. This is the type of error that cannot be
controlled by the programmer. But programmers can take some steps to
avoid this so that the application won't crash. The proper action can be
taken at this step.
