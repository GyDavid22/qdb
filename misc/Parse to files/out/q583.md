Records was added as a standard feature in Java 16. Records enable you
to create a POJO class with minimal code. Records automatically
generates hashCode(), equals(), getter methods, and toString() method
code for the class. Records are final and implicitly extend the
java.lang.Record class. The following example code shows one way to
cerate a record:

public record EmpRecord(int id, String name, long salary, Map \< String,
String \> addresses) {}
