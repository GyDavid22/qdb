Association is the loosest type of connection between two objects, when
there is no ownership or being part of something modelled.

Association is a relationship where all object have their own lifecycle
and there is no owner. Let's take the example of Teacher and Student.
Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and a single
student can associate with multiple teachers but there is no ownership
between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. These
relationships can be one to one, one to many, many to one and many to
many.
