IO is very important for performance of your Java application. Ideally
you should avoid IO in critical path of your application. Here are
couple of Java IO best practices you can follow:

-   Use buffered IO classes instead of reading individual bytes and
char.

-   Use classes from NIO and NIO2

-   Always close streams in finally block or use try-with-resource
statements.

-   use memory mapped file for faster IO.

If a Java candidate doesn't know about IO and NIO, especially if he has
at least 2 to 4 years of experience, he needs some reading.
