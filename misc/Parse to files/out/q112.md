The 'throw' keyword is used to manually throw the exception to the
calling method.

And the 'throws' keyword is used in the function definition to inform
the calling method that this method throws the exception. So if you are
calling, then you have to handle the exception.

Example:

class Main {

public static int testExceptionDivide(int a, int b) throws
ArithmeticException{

> if(a == 0 \|\| b == 0)

>> throw new ArithmeticException();

> return a/b;

}

public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> try{

>> testExceptionDivide(10, 0);

> }

> catch(ArithmeticException e){

>> //Handle the exception

> }

}

}

Here in the above snippet, the method testExceptionDivide throws an
exception. So if the main method is calling it then it must have handled
the exception. Otherwise, the main method can also throw the exception
to JVM.

And the method testExceptionDivide 'throws' the exception based on the
condition.
