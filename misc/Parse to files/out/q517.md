Garbage collection in Java a program which helps in implicit memory
management. Since in Java, using the new keyword you can create objects
dynamically, which once created will consume some memory. Once the job
is done and there are no more references left to the object, Java using
garbage collection destroys the object and relieves the memory occupied
by it. Java provides four types of garbage collectors:

-   Serial Garbage Collector

-   Parallel Garbage Collector

-   CMS Garbage Collector

-   G1 Garbage Collector

The Java programming language has four types of garbage collectors:

-   Serial Garbage Collector: Using only a single thread for garbage
collection, the serial garbage collector works by holding all the
application threads. It is designed especially for single-threaded
environments. Because serial garbage collector freezes all
application threads while performing garbage collection, it is most
suitable for command-line programs only. For using the serial
garbage collector, one needs to turn on the -XX:+UseSerialGC JVM
argument.

-   Parallel Garbage Collector: Also known as the throughput collector,
the parallel garbage collector is the default garbage collector of
the JVM. It uses multiple threads for garbage collection, and like a
serial garbage collector freezes all application threads during
garbage collection.

-   CMS Garbage Collector: Short for Concurrent Mark Sweep, CMS garbage
collector uses multiple threads for scanning the heap memory for
marking instances for eviction, followed by sweeping the marked
instances. There are only two scenarios when the CMS garbage
collector holds all the application threads:

-   When marking the referenced objects in the tenured generation
space.

-   If there is a change in the heap memory while performing the
garbage collection, CMS garbage collector ensures better
application throughput over parallel garbage collectors by using
more CPU resources. For using the CMS garbage collector, the
XX:+USeParNewGC JVM argument needs to be turned on.

-   G1 Garbage Collector: Used for large heap memory areas, G1 garbage
collector works by separating the heap memory into multiple regions
and then executing garbage collection in them in parallel. Unlike
the CMS garbage collector that compacts the memory on STW (Stop The
World) situations, G1 garbage collector compacts the free heap space
right after reclaiming the memory. Also, the G1 garbage collector
prioritizes the region with the most garbage. Turning on the
--XX:+UseG1GC JVM argument is required for using the G1 garbage
collector.
