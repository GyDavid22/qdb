Collection Framework is a combination of classes and interface, which is
used to store and manipulate the data in the form of objects. It
provides various classes such as ArrayList, Vector, Stack, and HashSet,
etc. and interfaces such as List, Queue, Set, etc. for this purpose.

A group of objects in Java is known as collections. Java.util package
contains, along with date and time facilities, internationalization,
legacy collection classes, etc., the various classes and interfaces for
collecting. Alternatively, collections can be considered as a framework
designed for storing the objects and manipulating the design in which
the objects are stored. You can use collections to perform the following
operations on objects:

-   Deletion

-   Insertion

-   Manipulation

-   Searching

-   Sorting

Following are the various constituents of the collections framework:

-   Classes: Array List, Linked List, Lists, and Vector

-   Interfaces: Collection, List, Map, Queue, Set, Sorted Map, and
Sorted Set

-   Maps: HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap

-   Queues: Priority Queue

-   Sets: Hash Set, Linked Hash Set, and Tree Set
