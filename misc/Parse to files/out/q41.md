System.out.println() is used to print the message on the console.
System - It is a class present in java.lang package. Out is the static
variable of type PrintStream class present in the System class.
println() is the method present in the PrintStream class. It prints its
argument to the standard output.

So if we justify the statement, then we can say that if we want to print
anything on the console then we need to call the println() method that
was present in PrintStream class. And we can call this using the output
object that is present in the System class.
