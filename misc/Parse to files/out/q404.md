Array and Collection are somewhat similar regarding storing the
references of objects and manipulating the data, but they differ in many
ways. The main differences between the array and Collection are defined
below:

-   Arrays are always of fixed size, i.e., a user can not increase or
decrease the length of the array according to their requirement or
at runtime, but In Collection, size can be changed dynamically as
per need.

-   Arrays can only store homogeneous or similar type objects, but in
Collection, heterogeneous objects can be stored.

-   Arrays cannot provide the ready-made methods for user requirements
as sorting, searching, etc. but Collection includes readymade
methods to use.
