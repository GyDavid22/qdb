The join() method waits for a thread to die. In other words, it causes
the currently running threads to stop executing until the thread it
joins with completes its task. Join method is overloaded in Thread class
in the following ways.

-   public void join()throws InterruptedException

-   public void join(long milliseconds)throws InterruptedException

Join () method is used to join one thread with the end of the currently
running thread.

Example:

public static void main(String\[\] args) {

>Thread t = new Thread();

>t.start();

>t.join();

}

Based on the above code, the main thread has started the execution. When
it reaches the code t.start() then 'thread t' starts the own stack for
the execution. JVM switches between the main thread and 'thread t'.

Once it reaches the code t.join() then 'thread t' alone is executed and
completes its task, then only the main thread starts the execution.

It is a non-static method. The Join () method has an overloaded version.
So we can mention the time duration in join () method also ".s".
