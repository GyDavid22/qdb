The interface is a blueprint for a class that has static constants and
abstract methods. It can be used to achieve full abstraction and
multiple inheritance. It is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There
can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It
is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. In
other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and
variables. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship. It
cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class. However, we need to
implement it to define its methods. Since Java 8, we can have the
default, static, and private methods in an interface.

Example:

public interface Animal {

>public void eat();

>public void sleep();

>public void run();

}
