The equals method is used to check whether two objects are the same or
not. It needs to be overridden if we want to check the objects based on
the property.

For example, Employee is a class that has 3 data members: id, name, and
salary. However, we want to check the equality of employee object by the
salary. Then, we need to override the equals() method.
