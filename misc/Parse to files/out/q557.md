Swapping numbers without using a third variable is a three-step process
that's better visualized in code:

b = b + a; // now b is sum of both the numbers

a = b - a; // b - a = (b + a) - a = b (a is swapped)

b = b - a; // (b + a) - b = a (b is swapped)

The following example code shows one way to implement the number swap
method:

public class SwapNumbers {

>public static void main(String\[\] args) {

>>int a = 10;

>>int b = 20;

>>System.out.println(\"a is \" + a + \" and b is \" + b);

>>a = a + b;

>>b = a - b;

>>a = a - b;

>>System.out.println(\"After swapping, a is \" + a + \" and b is \" +
b);

>}

}

The output shows that the integer values are swapped:

Output

a is 10 and b is 20

After swapping, a is 20 and b is 10
