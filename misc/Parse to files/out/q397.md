The java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock interface is used as the
synchronization mechanism. It works similar to the synchronized block.
There are a few differences between the lock and synchronized block that
are given below.

-   Lock interface provides the guarantee of sequence in which the
waiting thread will be given the access, whereas the synchronized
block doesn't guarantee it.

-   Lock interface provides the option of timeout if the lock is not
granted whereas the synchronized block doesn't provide that.

-   The methods of Lock interface, i.e., Lock() and Unlock() can be
called in different methods whereas single synchronized block must
be fully contained in a single method.
