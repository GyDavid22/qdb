Since there are only \"+\" operators in the above expressions,
precedence is not a concern, the evaluation proceeds from left to right.
The first output will be \"200Simplilearn\", because during the
evaluation the two integers are added first, then since we use "+" for
an integer and a string, Java takes the overload for the operator which
concatenates two strings, converting the left side to a string.

The second output will be \"E-Learning Company100100\", because now the
first operation is performed on a string and an integer, just like
before, so it concatenates the two operands, the situation is the same
with the second "+".
