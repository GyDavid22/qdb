There are three ways to instantiate the Class class.

-   forName() method of Class class: The forName() method is used to
load the class dynamically. It returns the instance of Class class.
It should be used if you know the fully qualified name of the class.
This cannot be used for primitive types.

-   getClass() method of Object class: It returns the instance of Class
class. It should be used if you know the type. Moreover, it can be
used with primitives.

-   the .class syntax: If a type is available, but there is no instance
then it is possible to obtain a Class by appending \".class\" to the
name of the type. It can be used for primitive data type also.
