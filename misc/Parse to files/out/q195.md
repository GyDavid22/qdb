Yes, we can declare static variables and methods in an abstract method.
As we know that there is no requirement to make the object to access the
static context, therefore, we can access the static context declared
inside the abstract class by using the name of the abstract class.
Consider the following example.

abstract class Test {

>static int i = 102;

>static void TestMethod()

>{

>>System.out.println(\"hi !! I am good !!\");

>}

}

public class TestClass extends Test {

>public static void main (String args\[\]) {

>>Test.TestMethod();

>>System.out.println(\"i = \"+Test.i);

>}

}

Output

hi !! I am good !!

i = 102
