Explanation

The method of Base class, i.e., baseMethod() is overridden in Derived
class. In Test class, the reference variable b (of type Base class)
refers to the instance of the Derived class. Here, Runtime polymorphism
is achieved between class Base and Derived. At compile time, the
presence of method baseMethod checked in Base class, If it presence then
the program compiled otherwise the compiler error will be shown. In this
case, baseMethod is present in Base class; therefore, it is compiled
successfully. However, at runtime, It checks whether the baseMethod has
been overridden by Derived class, if so then the Derived class method is
called otherwise Base class method is called. In this case, the Derived
class overrides the baseMethod; therefore, the Derived class method is
called.
