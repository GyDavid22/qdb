Deadlock is a situation in which every thread is waiting for a resource
which is held by some other waiting thread. In this situation, Neither
of the thread executes nor it gets the chance to be executed. Instead,
there exists a universal waiting state among all the threads. Deadlock
is a very complicated situation which can break our code at runtime.
