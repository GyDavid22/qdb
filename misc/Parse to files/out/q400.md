Java Callable interface: In Java5 callable interface was provided by the
package java.util.concurrent. It is similar to the Runnable interface
but it can return a result, and it can throw an Exception. It also
provides a run() method for execution of a thread. Java Callable can
return any object as it uses Generic.

Syntax:

public interface Callable\<V\>

Java Future interface: Java Future interface gives the result of a
concurrent process. The Callable interface returns the object of
java.util.concurrent.Future.

Java Future provides following methods for implementation.

-   cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning): It is used to cancel the
execution of the assigned task.

-   get(): It waits for the time if execution not completed and then
retrieved the result.

-   isCancelled(): It returns the Boolean value as it returns true if
the task was canceled before the completion.

-   isDone(): It returns true if the job is completed successfully else
returns false.
