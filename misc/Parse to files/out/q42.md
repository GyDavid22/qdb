Java thread life cycle is as follows:

-   New -- When the instance of the thread is created and the start()
method has not been invoked, the thread is considered to be alive
and hence in the NEW state.

-   Runnable -- Once the start() method is invoked, before the run()
method is called by JVM, the thread is said to be in RUNNABLE (ready
to run) state. This state can also be entered from the Waiting or
Sleeping state of the thread.

-   Running -- When the run() method has been invoked and the thread
starts its execution, the thread is said to be in a RUNNING state.

-   Non-Runnable (Blocked/Waiting) -- When the thread is not able to run
despite the fact of its aliveness, the thread is said to be in a
NON-RUNNABLE state. Ideally, after some time of its aliveness, the
thread should go to a runnable state.

-   A thread is said to be in a Blocked state if it wants to enter
synchronized code but it is unable to as another thread is
operating in that synchronized block on the same object. The
first thread has to wait until the other thread exits the
synchronized block.

-   A thread is said to be in a Waiting state if it is waiting for
the signal to execute from another thread, i.e it waits for work
until the signal is received.

-   Terminated -- Once the run() method execution is completed, the
thread is said to enter the TERMINATED step and is considered to not
be alive.

The following flowchart clearly explains the lifecycle of the thread in
Java.
