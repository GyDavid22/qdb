Synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple
threads to any shared resource. It is used:

-   To prevent thread interference.

-   To prevent consistency problem.

When the multiple threads try to do the same task, there is a
possibility of an erroneous result, hence to remove this issue, Java
uses the process of synchronization which allows only one thread to be
executed at a time. Synchronization can be achieved in three ways:

-   by the synchronized method

-   by synchronized block

-   by static synchronization

Syntax for synchronized block
