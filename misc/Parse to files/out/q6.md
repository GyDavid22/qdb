In Java, 5 memory areas are distinguished:

-   Class: the definitions of each class are here, including static
functions and static member variables.

-   Heap: For Java, this is where instances of objects are located, from
creation until no references point to them.

-   Stack: The local variables of functions are stored here. Each
function call has its own stackframe, which is freed as soon as the
function stops.

-   Program counter: Stores the memory address of the instruction at
which the program is at.

-   Native method stack: Memory space used by the called native
libraries of the OS.
