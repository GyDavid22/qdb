Yes, It is possible to use this keyword to refer static members because
this is just a reference variable which refers to the current class
object. However, as we know that, it is unnecessary to access static
variables through objects, therefore, it is not the best practice to use
this to refer static members. Consider the following example.

public class Test {

>static int i = 10;

>public Test () {

>>System.out.println(this.i);>

>}

>public static void main (String args\[\]) {

>>Test t = new Test();

>}

}

Output

10
