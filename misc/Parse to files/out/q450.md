The DriverManager class acts as an interface between user and drivers.
It keeps track of the drivers that are available and handles
establishing a connection between a database and the appropriate driver.
The DriverManager class maintains a list of Driver classes that have
registered themselves by calling the method
DriverManager.registerDriver().
