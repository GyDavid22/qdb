-   Java Servlet is server-side technologies to extend the capability of
web servers by providing support for dynamic response and data
persistence.

-   The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces
and classes for writing our own servlets.

-   All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface,
which defines servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic
service, we can extend the GenericServlet class provided with the
Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet class provides methods, such as
doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-specific services.

-   Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol
and thats why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API
hierarchy is shown in below image.
