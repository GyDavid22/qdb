We can stop a thread by using the following thread methods:

-   Sleeping

-   Waiting

-   Blocked

Sleep: Sleep () method is used to sleep the currently executing thread
for the given amount of time. Once the thread is wake up it can move to
the runnable state. So sleep () method is used to delay the execution
for some period.

It is a static method.

Example:

Thread. Sleep (2000)

So it delays the thread to sleep 2000 milliseconds. Sleep () method
throws an uninterrupted exception, hence we need to surround the block
with try/catch.

public class ExampleThread implements Runnable {

>public static void main(String\[\] args) {

>>Thread t = new Thread();

>>t.start();

>}

>public void run() {

>>try {

>>>Thread.sleep(2000);

>>} catch (InterruptedException e) {}

>}

}

-   Blocking: This method is used to put the thread in a blocked state.
The execution resumes as soon as the condition of the blocking is
met. For instance, the ServerSocket.accept() is a blocking method
that listens for incoming socket connections and resumes the blocked
thread only when a connection is made.

-   Sleeping: This method is used for delaying the execution of the
thread for some time. A thread upon which the sleep() method is used
is said to enter the sleep state. It enters the runnable state as
soon as it wakes up i.e., the sleep state is finished. The time for
which the thread needs to enter the sleep state is mentioned inside
the braces of the sleep() method. It is a static method.

-   Waiting: Although it can be called on any Java object, the wait()
method can only be called from a synchronized block.
