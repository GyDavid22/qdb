-   Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads, which are
waiting for the task to be allocated.

-   Threads in the thread pool are supervised by the service provider
which pulls one thread from the pool and assign a job to it.

-   After completion of the given task, thread again came to the thread
pool.

-   The size of the thread pool depends on the total number of threads
kept at reserve for execution.

The advantages of the thread pool are :

-   Using a thread pool, performance can be enhanced.

-   Using a thread pool, better system stability can occur.
