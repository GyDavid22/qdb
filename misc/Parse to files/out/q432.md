There are two ways to remove duplicates from the ArrayList.

-   Using HashSet: By using HashSet we can remove the duplicate element
from the ArrayList, but it will not then preserve the insertion
order.

-   Using LinkedHashSet: We can also maintain the insertion order by
using LinkedHashSet instead of HashSet.

The Process to remove duplicate elements from ArrayList using the
LinkedHashSet:

-   Copy all the elements of ArrayList to LinkedHashSet.

-   Empty the ArrayList using clear() method, which will remove all the
elements from the list.

-   Now copy all the elements of LinkedHashset to ArrayList.
