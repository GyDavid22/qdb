If you change the value in the properties file, you don't need to
recompile the java class. So, it makes the application easy to manage.
It is used to store information which is to be changed frequently.
Consider the following example.

public static void main(String\[\] args) throws Exception {

>FileReader reader = new FileReader(\"db.properties\");

>Properties p = new Properties();

>p.load(reader);

>System.out.println(p.getProperty(\"user\"));

>System.out.println(p.getProperty(\"password\"));

}

Output
