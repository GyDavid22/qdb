The following steps are used in database connectivity.

-   Registering the driver class:

The forName() method of the Class class is used to register the driver
class. This method is used to load the driver class dynamically.
Consider the following example to register OracleDriver class.

Class.forName(\"oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\");

-   Creating connection:

The getConnection() method of DriverManager class is used to establish
the connection with the database. The syntax of the getConnection()
method is given below.

-   public static Connection getConnection(String url)throws
SQLException

-   public static Connection getConnection(String url,String name,String
password)

throws SQLException

Consider the following example to establish the connection with the
Oracle database.

Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection(

\"jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe\",\"system\",\"password\");

-   Creating the statement:

The createStatement() method of Connection interface is used to create
the Statement. The object of the Statement is responsible for executing
queries with the database.

public Statement createStatement()throws SQLException

consider the following example to create the statement object

Statement stmt=con.createStatement();

-   Executing the queries:

The executeQuery() method of Statement interface is used to execute
queries to the database. This method returns the object of ResultSet
that can be used to get all the records of a table.

Syntax of executeQuery() method is given below.

public ResultSet executeQuery(String sql)throws SQLException

Example to execute the query

ResultSet rs=stmt.executeQuery(\"select \* from emp\");

while(rs.next()){

System.out.println(rs.getInt(1)+\" \"+rs.getString(2));

}

However, to perform the insert and update operations in the database,
executeUpdate() method is used which returns the boolean value to
indicate the successful completion of the operation.

-   Closing connection:

By closing connection, object statement and ResultSet will be closed
automatically. The close() method of Connection interface is used to
close the connection.

Syntax of close() method is given below.

public void close()throws SQLException

Consider the following example to close the connection.

con.close();
