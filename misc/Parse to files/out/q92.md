Spring MVC Framework provides the following ways to help us achieving
robust exception handling.

-   Controller Based:

We can define exception handler methods in our controller classes. All
we need is to annotate these methods with \@ExceptionHandler annotation.

-   Global Exception Handler:

Exception Handling is a cross-cutting concern and Spring provides
\@ControllerAdvice annotation that we can use with any class to define
our global exception handler.

-   HandlerExceptionResolver implementation:

For generic exceptions, most of the times we serve static pages. Spring
Framework provides HandlerExceptionResolver interface that we can
implement to create global exception handler. The reason behind this
additional way to define global exception handler is that Spring
framework also provides default implementation classes that we can
define in our spring bean configuration file to get spring framework
exception handling benefits.

-   XML Configuration: The user can use the
SimpleMappingExceptionResolver bean in Spring's application file and
map the exception.
