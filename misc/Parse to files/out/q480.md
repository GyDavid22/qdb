Get and post are two different HTTP verbs for two different actions. Get
is used for querying already available resources. Keep in mind that
using get, the request body must be empty, we can specify the query with
request parameters (query string). Post is for creating new resources.
The new object to create is mostly sent in the request body e.g. in JSON
format.

Example:

GET /items: The response will contain all available resources on this
location.

POST /items: We send a new resource in the request body, the server
might response with the URL of the newly created object, in this case
let it be /items/5.

GET /items/5: Now the response will contain the resource with an ID of
5, our newly created object.
