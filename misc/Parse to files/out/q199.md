As we know, that this refers to the current class object, therefore, it
must be similar to the current class object. However, there can be two
main advantages of passing this into a method instead of the current
class object.

this is a final variable. Therefore, this cannot be assigned to any new
value whereas the current class object might not be final and can be
changed.

this can be used in the synchronized block.
