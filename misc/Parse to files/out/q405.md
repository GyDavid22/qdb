Collection framework implements various interfaces, Collection interface
and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the mainly used interfaces of Java
Collection Framework. List of interfaces of Collection Framework is
given below:

-   Collection interface: Collection (java.util.Collection) is the
primary interface, and every collection must implement this
interface.

Syntax:

> public interface Collection\<E\>extends Iterable
>
> Where \<E\> represents that this interface is of Generic type

-   List interface: List interface extends the Collection interface, and
it is an ordered collection of objects. It contains duplicate
elements. It also allows random access of elements.

> Syntax:
>
> public interface List\<E\> extends Collection\<E\>

-   Set interface: Set (java.util.Set) interface is a collection which
cannot contain duplicate elements. It can only include inherited
methods of Collection interface

> Syntax:
>
> public interface Set\<E\> extends Collection\<E\>

-   Queue interface: Queue (java.util.Queue) interface defines queue
data structure, which stores the elements in the form FIFO (first in
first out).

> Syntax:
>
> public interface Queue\<E\> extends Collection\<E\>

-   Dequeue interface: it is a double-ended-queue. It allows the
insertion and removal of elements from both ends. It implants the
properties of both Stack and queue so it can perform LIFO (Last in
first out) stack and FIFO (first in first out) queue, operations.

> Syntax:
>
> public interface Dequeue\<E\> extends Queue\<E\>

-   Map interface: A Map (java.util.Map) represents a key, value pair
storage of elements. Map interface does not implement the Collection
interface. It can only contain a unique key but can have duplicate
elements. There are two interfaces which implement Map in java that
are Map interface and Sorted Map.
