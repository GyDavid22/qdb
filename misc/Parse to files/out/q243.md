There are the following advantages of Encapsulation in Java:

-   By providing only the setter or getter method, you can make the
class read-only or write-only. In other words, you can skip the
getter or setter methods.

-   It provides you the control over the data. Suppose you want to set
the value of id which should be greater than 100 only, you can write
the logic inside the setter method. You can write the logic not to
store the negative numbers in the setter methods.

-   It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will
not be able to access the data through the private data members.

-   The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit
testing.

-   The standard IDEs are providing the facility to generate the getters
and setters. So, it is easy and fast to create an encapsulated class
in Java.
