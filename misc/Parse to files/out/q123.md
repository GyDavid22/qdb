int\[\] n1 = new int\[0\];

boolean\[\] n2 = new boolean\[-200\];

double\[\] n3 = new double\[2241423798\];

char\[\] ch = new char\[20\];

n3 will give a compile time error, because array sizes are in int and
that number is bigger than what an integer can store. Other than that,
n2 will give a runtime exception of NegativeArraySizeException. The
reason because it doesn't give a compile-time error is that JVM will try
to allocate the memory area in runtime, and that's when it notices the
negative integer. Also, an integer too big can't happen during runtime,
so we can check that during the compilation, meanwhile the size of an
array can be decided during runtime, which means a compile-time can't
filter out these cases.
