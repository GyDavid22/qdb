There are the following differences between the process and thread.

-   A Program in the execution is called the process whereas; A thread
is a subset of the process

-   Processes are independent whereas threads are the subset of process.

-   Process have different address space in memory, while threads
contain a shared address space.

-   Context switching is faster between the threads as compared to
processes.

-   Inter-process communication is slower and expensive than
inter-thread communication.

-   Any change in Parent process doesn't affect the child process
whereas changes in parent thread can affect the child thread.
