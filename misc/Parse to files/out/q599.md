wait() method should always be called in loop because it's possible
that until thread gets CPU to start running again the condition might
not hold, so it's always better to check condition in loop before
proceeding. Here is the standard idiom of using wait and notify method
in Java:

// The standard idiom for using the wait method

synchronized (obj) {

while (condition does not hold)

> obj.wait(); // (Releases lock, and reacquires on wakeup)

> \... // Perform action appropriate to condition

}
