Hibernate has a layered architecture which helps the user to operate
without having to know the underlying APIs. Hibernate makes use of the
database and configuration data to provide persistence services (and
persistent objects) to the application. It includes many objects such as
persistent object, session factory, transaction factory, connection
factory, session, transaction etc.
