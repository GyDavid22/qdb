Output

Calculation class is instantiated

The sum is 30

Explanation

The object of Calculation is thrown from the try block which is caught
in the catch block. The add() of Calculation class is called with the
integer values 10 and 20 by using the object of this class. Therefore
there sum 30 is printed. The object of the Main class can only be thrown
in the case when the type of the object is throwable. To do so, we need
to extend the throwable class.
