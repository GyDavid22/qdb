When you go migrate your Java application from 32-bit to 64-bit JVM, the
heap requirement suddenly increases, almost double, due to increasing
size of ordinary object pointer from 32 bit to 64 bit. This also
adversely affect how much data you can keep in CPU cache, which is much
smaller than memory. Since main motivation for moving to 64-bit JVM is
to specify large heap size, you can save some memory by using compressed
OOP. By using -XX:+UseCompressedOops, JVM uses 32-bit OOP instead of
64-bit OOP.
