Method overloading occurs during the compile time, whereas method
overriding occurs during the run time. Static binding is used during
overloading, whereas dynamic binding is used during methods overriding.
In Java , method overloading is made possible by introducing different
methods in the same class consisting of the same name. Still, all the
functions differ in the number or type of parameters. It takes place
inside a class and enhances program readability. The only difference in
the return type of the method does not promote method overloading.

Method overriding is the concept in which two methods having the same
method signature are present in two different classes in which an
inheritance relationship is present. A particular method implementation
(already present in the base class) is possible for the derived class by
using method overriding.

//Function overloading

//function1

void addPodium(int a, int b) {

>System.out.println(a + b);

}

//function2

float addPodium(float a, float b, float c) {

>System.out.println(a + b + c);

}

//Function overriding

class Parent {

>void show() {

>>System.out.println(\"I am Parent\");

>}

}

class Child extends Parent {

>void show() {

>>System.out.println(\"I am Child\");

>}

}

class Main {

>public static void main(String\[\] args) {

>>Parent obja = new Parent();

>>obja.show();

>>Parent objb = new Child();

>>objb.show();

>}

}

Using the \@Override annotation is not necessary but it can be really
helpful as we will get a compile-time error if we made a mistake.
