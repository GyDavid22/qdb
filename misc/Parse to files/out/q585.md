The switch expressions were added as a standard feature in Java 14. The
following examples show switch expressions as well as multi-label case
statements:

int choice = 2;

int x =

>switch (choice) {

>>case 1, 2, 3:

>>>yield choice;

>>default:

>>>yield - 1;

>};

System.out.println(\"x = \" + x); // x = 2

You can also use lambda expressions in switch expressions.

String day = \"TH\";

String result =

>switch (day) {

>>case \"M\", \"W\", \"F\" - > \"MWF\";

>>case \"T\", \"TH\", \"S\" - > \"TTS\";

>>default - > {

>>>if (day.isEmpty())

>>>>yield \"Please insert a valid day.\";

>>>else

>>>>yield \"Looks like a Sunday.\";

>>}

>};

System.out.println(result); // TTH
