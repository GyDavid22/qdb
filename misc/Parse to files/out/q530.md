There are two types of Exceptions. They are explained below in detail.

-   Checked Exception:

> These exceptions are checked by the compiler at the time of
> compilation. Classes that extend Throwable class except Runtime
> exception and Error are called checked Exception.
>
> Checked Exceptions must either declare the exception using throws
> keyword (or) surrounded by appropriate try/catch.

For Example, ClassNotFound Exception

-   Unchecked Exception:

> These exceptions are not checked during the compile time by the
> compiler. The compiler doesn't force to handle these exceptions. It
> includes:
>
> Arithmetic Exception
>
> ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception
