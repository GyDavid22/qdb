This is a convenient means of initializing any collections in Java.
Consider the below example.

import java.util.HashSet;

import java.util.Set;

public class IBDoubleBraceDemo{

public static void main(String\[\] args){

> Set\<String> stringSets = new HashSet\<String>()

> {

>> {

>>> add(\"set1\");

>>> add(\"set2\");

>>> add(\"set3\");

>> }

> };

> doSomething(stringSets);

}

private static void doSomething(Set\<String> stringSets){

> System.out.println(stringSets);

}

}

In the above example, we see that the stringSets were initialized by
using double braces.

The first brace does the task of creating an anonymous inner class that
has the capability of accessing the parent class's behavior. In our
example, we are creating the subclass of HashSet so that it can use the
add() method of HashSet.

The second brace is an initialization block.

Care should be taken while initializing through this method as the
method involves the creation of anonymous inner classes which can cause
problems during the garbage collection or serialization processes and
may also result in memory leaks.
