All three keywords have their own utility while programming.

Final: If any restriction is required for classes, variables, or
methods, the final keyword comes in handy. Inheritance of a final class
and overriding of a final method is restricted by the use of the final
keyword. The variable value becomes fixed after incorporating the final
keyword. Example:

final int a=100;

a = 0; // error

The second statement will throw an error.

Finally: It is the block present in a program where all the codes
written inside it get executed irrespective of handling of exceptions.
Example:

try {

int variable = 5;

}

catch (Exception exception) {

System.out.println(\"Exception occurred\");

}

finally {

System.out.println(\"Execution of finally block\");

}

Finalize: Prior to the garbage collection of an object, the finalize
method is called so that the clean-up activity is implemented. Example:

public static void main(String\[\] args) {

String example = new String(\"InterviewBit\");

example = null;

System.gc(); // Garbage collector called

}

public void finalize() {

// Finalize called
