No, unfortunately, DateFormat and all its implementations including
SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe, hence should not be used in the
multi-threaded program until external thread-safety measures are applied
e.g. confining SimpleDateFormat object into a ThreadLocal variable.

If you don't do that, you will get an incorrect result while parsing or
formatting dates in Java. Though, for all practical date time purpose, I
highly recommend joda-time library.
