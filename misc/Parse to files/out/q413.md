The differences between the HashSet and HashMap are listed below.

-   HashSet contains only values whereas HashMap includes the entry
(key, value). HashSet can be iterated, but HashMap needs to convert
into Set to be iterated.

-   HashSet implements Set interface whereas HashMap implements the Map
interface

-   HashSet cannot have any duplicate value whereas HashMap can contain
duplicate values with unique keys.

-   HashSet contains the only single number of null value whereas
HashMap can hold a single null key with n number of null values.
