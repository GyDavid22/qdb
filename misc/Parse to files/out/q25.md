When the main method is not declared as static, then the program may be
compiled correctly but ends up with a severe ambiguity and throws a run
time error that reads \"NoSuchMethodError.\" Java's main() function is
static by default, allowing the compiler to call it either before or
after creating a class object. The main () function is where the
compiler begins programme execution in every Java programme. Thus, the
main () method needs to be called by the compiler. If the main () method
is permitted to be non-static, the JVM must instantiate its class when
calling the function.

The main method is always static because static members are those
methods that belong to the classes, not to an individual object. JVM
calls the main method based on the class name itself, not by creating
the object.

If we made the main method non-static, JVM would have to create its
object first and then call main() method which will lead to the extra
memory allocation.
