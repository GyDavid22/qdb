There are many ways:

-   By nulling the reference

-   By assigning a reference to another

-   By anonymous object etc.

![Java Garbage Collection
Scenario](image65.jpeg){}

-   By nulling a reference:

> Employee e=new Employee();
>
> e=null;

-   By assigning a reference to another:

> Employee e1=new Employee();
>
> Employee e2=new Employee();
>
> e1=e2;//now the first object referred by e1 is available for garbage
> collection

-   By anonymous object:

new Employee();
