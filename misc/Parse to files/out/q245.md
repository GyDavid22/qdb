There are two ways to access a class in another class.

-   By using the fully qualified name: To access a class in a different
package, either we must use the fully qualified name of that class,
or we must import the package containing that class.

-   By using the relative path, We can use the path of the class that is
related to the package that contains our class. It can be the same
or subpackage.
