A yield () method moves the currently running thread to a runnable state
and allows the other threads for execution. So that equal priority
threads have a chance to run. It is a static method. It doesn't release
any lock.

Yield () method moves the thread back to the Runnable state only, and
not the thread to sleep (), wait () (or) block.

Example:

public static void main(String\[\] args) {

>Thread t = new Thread();

>t.start();

}

public void run() {

>Thread.yield();

}
