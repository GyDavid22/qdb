}

The output of the above code will be

200Javatpoint

Javatpoint200

Explanation

In the first case, The numbers 10 and 20 will be multiplied first and
then the result 200 is treated as the string and concatenated with the
string Javatpoint to produce the output 200Javatpoint.b

In the second case, The numbers 10 and 20 will be multiplied first to be
200 because the precedence of the multiplication is higher than
addition. The result 200 will be treated as the string and concatenated
with the string Javatpointto produce the output as Javatpoint200.
