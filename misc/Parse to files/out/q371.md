The sleep() method in java is used to block a thread for a particular
time, which means it pause the execution of a thread for a specific
time. There are two methods of doing so.

Syntax:

-   public static void sleep(long milliseconds)throws
InterruptedException

-   public static void sleep(long milliseconds, int nanos)throws
InterruptedException

Working of sleep() method

When we call the sleep() method, it pauses the execution of the current
thread for the given time and gives priority to another thread(if
available). Moreover, when the waiting time completed then again
previous thread changes its state from waiting to runnable and comes in
running state, and the whole process works so on till the execution
doesn't complete.
