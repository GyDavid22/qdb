Access specifiers or access modifiers are used to set the availability
scope of an attribute of an object. There are 4 of them:

-   Private: only visible from inside the object

-   Protected: only visible from inside the object and from the
descendants of the object

-   Public: visible from everywhere

-   Package: only visible from objects in the same package (this one has
no keyword, it's the default value)
