The instanceof in Java is also known as type comparison operator because
it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. If
we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has a null
value, it returns false. Consider the following example.

class Simple1 {

>public static void main(String args\[\]) {

>>Simple1 s = new Simple1();

>>System.out.println(s instanceof Simple1); //true

>}

}

Output

true

An object of subclass type is also a type of parent class. For example,
if Dog extends Animal then object of Dog can be referred by either Dog
or Animal class.
