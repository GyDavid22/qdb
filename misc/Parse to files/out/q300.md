Java FileOutputStream is an output stream used for writing data to a
file. If you have some primitive values to write into a file, use
FileOutputStream class. You can write byte-oriented as well as
character-oriented data through the FileOutputStream class. However, for
character-oriented data, it is preferred to use FileWriter than
FileOutputStream. Consider the following example of writing a byte into
a file.

import java.io.FileOutputStream;

public class FileOutputStreamExample {

>public static void main(String args\[\]) {

>>try {

>>>FileOutputStream fout = new
FileOutputStream(\"D:\\\\testout.txt\");

>>>fout.write(65);

>>>fout.close();

>>>System.out.println(\"success\...\");

>>} catch (Exception e) {

>>>System.out.println(e);

>>}

>}

}

Java FileInputStream class obtains input bytes from a file. It is used
for reading byte-oriented data (streams of raw bytes) such as image
data, audio, video, etc. You can also read character-stream data.
However, for reading streams of characters, it is recommended to use
FileReader class. Consider the following example for reading bytes from
a file.

import java.io.FileInputStream;

public class DataStreamExample {

>public static void main(String args\[\]) {

>>try {

>>>FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(\"D:\\\\testout.txt\");

>>>int i = fin.read();

>>>System.out.print((char) i);

>>>fin.close();

>>} catch (Exception e) {

>>>System.out.println(e);

>>}

>}

}
