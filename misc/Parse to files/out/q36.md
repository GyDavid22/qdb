ArrayList is implemented in such a way that it can grow dynamically. We
don't need to specify the size of ArrayList. For adding the values in
it, the methodology it uses is:

1\. Consider initially that there are 2 elements in the ArrayList. \[2,
3\].

2\. If we need to add the element into this. Then internally what will
happen is:

-   ArrayList will allocate the new ArrayList of Size (current size +
half of the current size). And add the old elements into the new.
Old - \[2, 3\],\>New - \[2, 3, null\].

-   Then the new value will be inserted into it. \[2, 3, 4, null\]. And
for the next time, the extra space will be available for the value
to be inserted.

3\. This process continues and the time taken to perform all of these is
considered as the amortized constant time.

This is how the ArrayList grows dynamically. And when we delete any
entry from the ArrayList then the following steps are performed.

1\. It searches for the element index in the array. Searching takes some
time. Typically it's O(n) because it needs to search for the element in
the entire array.

2\. After searching the element, it needs to shift the element from the
right side to fill the index.

So this is how the elements are deleted from the ArrayList internally.
Similarly, the search operations are also implemented internally as
defined in removing elements from the list (searching for elements to
delete).
