This example refers to the following Java file:

public class Test {

public static void main(String args\[\]) {

>>System.out.println(\"Hi\");

>}

}

You can compile it using the following command in your terminal:

javac Test.java

To run the class, use the following command in your terminal:

java Test

For the recent releases, the java command will also compile the program
if the class file is not present. If the class is in a package, such as
com.example, then it should be inside the folder com/example. The
command to compile and run is:

java com/example/Test.java

If your class requires some additional JARs to compile and run, you can
use the java -cp option. For example:

java -cp .:\~/.m2/repository/log4j/log4j/1.2.17/log4j-1.2.17.jar
com/example/Test.java
