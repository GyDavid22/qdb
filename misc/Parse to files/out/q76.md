These 2 are the bitwise right shift operators. Although both operators
look similar. But there is a minimal difference between these two right
shift operators.

-   '\>\>' Bitwise Right Shift Operator- This operator shifts each bit
to its right position. And this maintains the signed bit.

-   '\>\>\>' Bitwise Right Shift Operator with trailing zero- This
operator also shifts each bit to its right. But this doesn't
maintain the signed bit. This operator makes the Most significant
bit to 0.

Example: Num1 = 8, Num2 = -8.

So the binary form of these numbers are:

Num1 = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001000

Num2 = 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000

'\>\>' Operator : 8 \>\> 1 (Shift by one bit):

Num1 = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000100

Num2 = 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111100

'\>\>\>' Operator : 8 \>\>\> 1 (Shift by one bit):

Num1 = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000100

Num2 = 01111111 11111111 11111111 11111100
