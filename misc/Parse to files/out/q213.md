Yes, we can modify the throws clause of the superclass method while
overriding it in the subclass. However, there are some rules which are
to be followed while overriding in case of exception handling.

-   If the superclass method does not declare an exception, subclass
overridden method cannot declare the checked exception, but it can
declare the unchecked exception.

-   If the superclass method declares an exception, subclass overridden
method can declare same, subclass exception or no exception but
cannot declare parent exception.
