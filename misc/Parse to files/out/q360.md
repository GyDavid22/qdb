A thread is a lightweight subprocess. It is a separate path of execution
because each thread runs in a different stack frame. A process may
contain multiple threads. Threads share the process resources, but
still, they execute independently. In Java, all the programs will have
at least one thread which is known as the main thread. This main thread
is created by the JVM when the program starts its execution. The main
thread is used to invoke the main() of the program.
