Runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch is a process in which a
call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at
compile-time. In this process, an overridden method is called through
the reference variable of a superclass. The determination of the method
to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference
variable.

class Bike {

>void run() {

>>System.out.println(\"running\");

>}

}

class Splendor extends Bike {

>void run() {

>>System.out.println(\"running safely with 60km\");

>}

>public static void main(String args\[\]) {

>>Bike b = new Splendor(); //upcasting

>>b.run();

>}

}

Output:

running safely with 60km.

In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference
variable of a superclass. The determination of the method to be called
