There are two types of advantages of Java inner classes.

-   Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it
can access all the members (data members and methods) of the outer
class including private.

-   Nested classes are used to develop a more readable and maintainable
code because it logically groups classes and interfaces in one place
only.

-   Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.
