The forEach() method provides a shortcut to perform an action on all the
elements of an iterable. The following example code shows how to iterate
over the list elements and print them:

List\<String> list = new ArrayList\<>();

Iterator\<String> it = list.iterator();

while (it.hasNext()) {

>System.out.println(it.next());

}

You can use the forEach() method with a lambda expression to reduce the
code size, as shown in the following example code:

List\<String\> list = new ArrayList\<\>();

list.forEach(System.out::print);
