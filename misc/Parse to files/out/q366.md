A thread can have one of the following states during its lifetime:

-   New: In this state, a Thread class object is created using a new
operator, but the thread is not alive. Thread doesn't start until
we call the start() method.

-   Runnable: In this state, the thread is ready to run after calling
the start() method. However, the thread is not yet selected by the
thread scheduler.

-   Running: In this state, the thread scheduler picks the thread from
the ready state, and the thread is running.

-   Waiting/Blocked: In this state, a thread is not running but still
alive, or it is waiting for the other thread to finish.

-   Dead/Terminated: A thread is in terminated or dead state when the
run() method exits.
