Queue Interface

Priority Queue: Linked list class has been enhanced to implement the
queue interface. Queues can be handled with a linked list. The purpose
of a queue is "Priority-in, Priority-out".

Hence elements are ordered either naturally or according to the
comparator. The elements ordering represents their relative priority.

A priority queue, like a regular queue, is an abstract data type, but it
has a priority associated with each element contained by it.

The element with the high priority is served before the element with low
priority in a priority queue. Elements in a priority queue are ordered
either according to the comparator or naturally. The order of the
elements in a priority queue represents their relative priority.
