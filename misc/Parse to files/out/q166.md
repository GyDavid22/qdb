In the above program, a total of 7 objects will be eligible for garbage
collection. Let's visually understand what's happening in the code.

In the above figure on line 3, we can see that on each array index we
are declaring a new array so the reference will be of that new array on
all the 3 indexes. So the old array will be pointed to by none. So these
three are eligible for garbage collection. And on line 4, we are
creating a new array object on the older reference. So that will point
to a new array and older multidimensional objects will become eligible
for garbage collection.
