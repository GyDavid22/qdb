Java Servlets provide several authentication options:

-   Basic Authentication: Usernames and passwords are provided by the
client to authenticate the user.

-   Form-Based Authentication: Programmers create a login form using
HTML.

-   Digest Authentication: Similar to basic authentication, but
passwords are encrypted using a Hash formula, making it more secure.

-   Client Certificate Authentication: Requires each client to have a
certificate, which it sends to authenticate itself. Typically used
with the SSL protocol for added security.
