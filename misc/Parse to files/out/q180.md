The constructor can be defined as the special type of method that is
used to initialize the state of an object. It is invoked when the class
is instantiated, and the memory is allocated for the object. Every time,
an object is created using the new keyword, the default constructor of
the class is called. The name of the constructor must be similar to the
class name. The constructor must not have an explicit return type.

-   When a new object is created in a program a constructor gets invoked
corresponding to the class.

-   The constructor is a method which has the same name as the class
name.

-   If a user doesn't create a constructor implicitly a default
constructor will be created.

-   The constructor can be overloaded.

-   If the user created a constructor with a parameter then he should
create another constructor explicitly without a parameter.
