Thread-local variables are variables confined to a thread, its like
thread's own copy which is not shared between multiple threads. Java
provides a ThreadLocal class to support thread-local variables. It's
one of the many ways to achieve thread-safety.

Though be careful while using thread local variable in managed
environment e.g. with web servers where worker thread out lives any
application variable. Any thread local variable which is not removed
once its work is done can potentially cause a memory leak in Java
application.
