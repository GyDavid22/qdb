Concept: C++: \"Write once, compile everywhere.\"; Java: \"Write once,
run everywhere.\" That is, unlike the above, C++ turns to OS and
architecture specific machine code.

Language compatibility: C++ was created as an object-oriented extension
of C, i.e. you can use C libraries and write C code in C++ (the reverse
is not true), but many high-level programming languages support C++,
e.g. Java. Java is not typically supported by other languages, except of
course for languages running on the JVM, e.g. Kotlin.

System libraries: C++ can natively handle OS system libraries, so C++
programs can take better advantage of the OS's capabilities. While in
the case of Java, the Java Native Interface can help achieve the same,
accessing system libraries natively with stock libraries is not
possible.

Characteristics: C++ does not force either procedural or object-oriented
programming, although both are supported. Since C++ is native code, we
must take care of freeing up the heap content (allocated with \"new\"
operator) space. For Java, all code must be part of a class, and freeing
up unnecessary memory space is always automatic (garbage collection).

Semantics of types: in C++, primitive types and objects work the same
way from the memory perspective. In Java, primitive types are found in
the stack, classes are always derived from the \"Object\" class, also
objects are always addressed by references and are found on the heap.

Interpreted/compiled: Java is also commonly referred to as a compiled
(Java code -> JVM bytecode) and interpreted (bytecode run by JVM)
language, while C++ is strictly a compiled (C++ code -> machine code)
language.

Inheritance: While C++ allows a class to have multiple inheritances,
Java doesn't to avoid the diamond problem.
