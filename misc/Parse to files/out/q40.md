Concurrent execution of different processes is made possible by
synchronization. When a particular resource is shared between many
threads, situations may arise in which multiple threads require the same
shared resource.

Synchronization assists in resolving the issue and the resource is
shared by a single thread at a time. Let's take an example to understand
it more clearly. For example, you have a URL and you have to find out
the number of requests made to it. Two simultaneous requests can make
the count erratic.

No synchronization:

package anonymous;

public class Counting {

> private int increase_counter;

> public int increase() {

>>> increase_counter = increase_counter + 1;

>>> return increase_counter;

> }

}

![](image23.png){}

If a thread Thread1 views the count as 10, it will be increased by 1 to
11. Simultaneously, if another thread Thread2 views the count as 10, it
will be increased by 1 to 11. Thus, inconsistency in count values takes
place because the expected final value is 12 but the actual final value
we get will be 11.

Now, the function increase() is made synchronized so that simultaneous
accessing cannot take place.

With synchronization:

package anonymous;

public class Counting {

> private int increase_counter;

> public synchronized int increase() {

>>> increase_counter = increase_counter + 1;

>>> return increase_counter;

> }

}

![](image24.png){}

If a thread Thread1 views the count as 10, it will be increased by 1 to
11, then the thread Thread2 will view the count as 11, it will be
increased by 1 to 12. Thus, consistency in count values takes place.
