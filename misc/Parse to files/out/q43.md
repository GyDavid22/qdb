-   The main advantage of having an ordered array is the reduced search
time complexity of O(log n) whereas the time complexity in an
unordered array is O(n).

-   The main drawback of the ordered array is its increased insertion
time which is O(n) due to the fact that its element has to reordered
to maintain the order of array during every insertion whereas the
time complexity in the unordered array is only O(1).

-   Considering the above 2 key points and depending on what kind of
scenario a developer requires, the appropriate data structure can be
used for implementation.
