A class can be made write-only by making all of the fields private. The
write-only class will have only setter methods which set the value
passed from the main method to the private fields. We cannot read the
properties of the class because there is no getter method in this class.
Consider the following example.

//A Java class which has only setter methods.>

public class Student {

>//private data member>

>private String college;

>//setter method for college>

>public void setCollege(String college) {

>>this.college = college;

>}

}
