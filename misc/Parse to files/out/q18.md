A singleton class is a class which can only be instantiated once and
only has one instance. One example to implement it is to set all
constructors to private then add a static getter method to the class
which returns that one instance (and instantiate it before if it haven't
been already).

One example to implement a singleton class:

class WaterJug{

private int waterQuantity = 500;

private WaterJug(){}

private WaterJug object = null;

// Method to provide the service of Giving Water.

public int getWater(int quantity){

> waterQuantity -= quantity;

> return quantity;

}

// Method to return the object to the user.

public static Waterjug getInstance(){

> // Will Create a new object if the object is not already created and
return the object.

> if(object == null){

>> object = new WaterJug();

> }

> return object;

}

}
