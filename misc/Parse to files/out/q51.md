There are four supported scopes of a Spring bean: singleton, prototype,
request, and session.

The singleton scope creates a single instance of a bean, which is shared
by all objects that request it.

The prototype scope creates a new instance of a bean for each object
that requests it.

The request and session scopes are only available in a web-based
context. The request scope creates a new bean instance for each HTTP
request, and the session scope creates a single instance of a bean
shared by all objects in a single HTTP session.

The ways we can set a scope are using the \@Scope annotation or the
scope attribute in the configuration XML file.

To set the scope using the \`@Scope\` annotation, you can specify it on
the bean class or the bean definition method within a configuration
class. Here's an example:

\@Configuration

public class MyConfig {

>@Bean

>@Scope(\"singleton\")

>public MyBean singletonBean() {

>>return new MyBean();

>}

>@Bean

>@Scope(\"prototype\")

>public MyBean prototypeBean() {

>>return new MyBean();

>}

}

In this example, the \`singletonBean\` method is annotated with
\`@Scope("singleton")\`, indicating that the bean will have a singleton
scope. The \`prototypeBean\` method is annotated with
\`@Scope("prototype")\`, specifying a prototype scope.
