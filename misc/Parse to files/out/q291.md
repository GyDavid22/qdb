The finalize() method is invoked just before the object is garbage
collected. It is used to perform cleanup processing. The Garbage
collector of JVM collects only those objects that are created by new
keyword. So if you have created an object without new, you can use the
finalize method to perform cleanup processing (destroying remaining
objects). The cleanup processing is the process to free up all the
resources, network which was previously used and no longer needed. It is
essential to remember that it is not a reserved keyword, finalize method
is present in the object class hence it is available in every class as
object class is the superclass of every class in java. Here, we must
note that neither finalization nor garbage collection is guaranteed.
Consider the following example.

public class FinalizeTest {

>int j = 12;

>void add() {

>>j = j + 12;

>>System.out.println(\"J=\" + j);

>}

>public void finalize() {

>>System.out.println(\"Object is garbage collected\");

>}

>public static void main(String\[\] args) {

>>new FinalizeTest().add();

>>System.gc();

>>new FinalizeTest().add();

>}

}
