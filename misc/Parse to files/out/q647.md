Here are couple of best practices which I follow while writing
concurrent code in Java:

-   Always name your thread, this will help in debugging.

-   minimize the scope of synchronization, instead of making whole
method synchronized, only critical section should be synchronized.

-   prefer volatile over synchronized if you can can.

-   use higher level concurrency utilities instead of wait() and notify
for inter thread communication e.g. BlockingQueue, CountDownLatch
and Semaphore.

-   Prefer concurrent collection over synchronized collection in Java.
They provide better scalability.
