JDBC Driver is a software component that enables Java application to
interact with the database. There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:

-   JDBC-ODBC bridge driver: The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver uses the ODBC
driver to connect to the database. The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver
converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC function calls. This is now
discouraged because of the thin driver. It is easy to use and can be
easily connected to any database.

-   Native-API driver (partially java driver): The Native API driver
uses the client-side libraries of the database. The driver converts
JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API. It is not
written entirely in Java. Its performance is better than JDBC-ODBC
bridge driver. However, the native driver must be installed on each
client machine.

-   Network Protocol driver (fully java driver): The Network Protocol
driver uses middleware (application server) that converts JDBC calls
directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol.
It is entirely written in Java. There is no requirement of the
client-side library because of the application server that can
perform many tasks like auditing, load balancing, logging, etc.

-   Thin driver (fully java driver): The thin driver converts JDBC calls
directly into the vendor-specific database protocol. That is why it
is known as the thin driver. It is entirely written in Java
language. Its performance is better than all other drivers however
these drivers depend upon the database.
