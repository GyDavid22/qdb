There are various advantages of using inheritance in Java that is given
below.

-   Inheritance provides code reusability. The derived class does not
need to redefine the method of base class unless it needs to provide
the specific implementation of the method.

-   Runtime polymorphism cannot be achieved without using inheritance.

-   We can simulate the inheritance of classes with the real-time
objects which makes OOPs more realistic.

-   Inheritance provides data hiding. The base class can hide some data
from the derived class by making it private.

-   Method overriding cannot be achieved without inheritance. By method
overriding, we can give a specific implementation of some basic
method contained by the base class.
