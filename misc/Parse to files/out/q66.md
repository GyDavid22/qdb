In general JIT (just in time compilation) refers to a compilation
method, where the code gets compiled during runtime. (Opposed to AOT
(ahead of time), when the code is compiled completely before the program
starts running.) One advantage of JIT compiling is having reduced
compilation time. The compiler is nothing but a translator of source
code to machine-executable code. But what is special about the JIT
compiler? Let us see how it works:

-   First, the Java source code (.java) conversion to byte code (.class)
occurs with the help of the javac compiler.

-   Then, the .class files are loaded at run time by JVM and with the
help of an interpreter, these are converted to machine
understandable code.

-   JIT compiler is a part of JVM. When the JIT compiler is enabled, the
JVM analyzes the method calls in the .class files and compiles them
to get more efficient and native code. It also ensures that the
prioritized method calls are optimized.

-   Once the above step is done, the JVM executes the optimized code
directly instead of interpreting the code again. This increases the
performance and speed of the execution.
