Instance variables and local variables are two types of variables in
Java. Instance variables are declared inside a class but outside any
method. They are used to store data that is specific to an object and
are accessible from any method of the given class. Local variables, on
the other hand, are declared inside a method or a code block and are
used to store temporary data that is required only within that method.

In Java, a local variable is typically used inside a method,
constructor, or a block and has only local scope. Thus, this variable
can be used only within the scope of a block. The best benefit of having
a local variable is that other methods in the class won't be even aware
of that variable.

Example

if(x > 100) {

>String test = \"Edureka\";

}

Whereas, an instance variable in Java, is a variable which is bounded to
its object itself. These variables are declared within a class, but
outside a method. Every object of that class will create it's own copy
of the variable while using it. Thus, any changes made to the variable
won't reflect in any other instances of that class and will be bound to
that particular instance only.

class Test {

>public String EmpName;

>public int empAge;

}
