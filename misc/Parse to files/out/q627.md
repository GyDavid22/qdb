Theoretically, the maximum heap memory you can assign to a 32-bit JVM is
2\^32 which is 4GB but practically the limit is much smaller. It also
varies between operating systems e.g. form 1.5GB in Windows to almost
3GB in Solaris. 64-bit JVM allows you to specify larger heap size,
theoretically 2\^64 which is quite large but practically you can specify
heap space up to 100GBs. There are even JVM e.g. Azul where heap space
of 1000 gigs is also possible.
