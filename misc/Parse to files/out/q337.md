An applet is a small java program that runs inside the browser and
generates dynamic content. It is embedded in the webpage and runs on the
client side. It is secured and takes less response time. It can be
executed by browsers running under many platforms, including Linux,
Windows, Mac Os, etc. However, the plugins are required at the client
browser to execute the applet. The following image shows the
architecture of Applet.
