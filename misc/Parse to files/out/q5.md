Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files.
Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader.
There are three built-in classloaders in Java.

-   Bootstrap ClassLoader: This is the first classloader which is the
superclass of Extension classloader. It loads the rt.jar file which
contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like java.lang
package classes, java.net package classes, java.util package
classes, java.io package classes, java.sql package classes, etc.

-   Extension ClassLoader: This is the child classloader of Bootstrap
and parent classloader of System classloader. It loads the jar files
located inside \$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory.

-   System/Application ClassLoader: This is the child classloader of
Extension classloader. It loads the class files from the classpath.
By default, the classpath is set to the current directory. You can
change the classpath using \"-cp\" or \"-classpath\" switch. It is
also known as Application classloader.
