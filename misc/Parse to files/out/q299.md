All the stream classes can be divided into two types of classes that are
ByteStream classes and CharacterStream Classes. The ByteStream classes
are further divided into InputStream classes and OutputStream classes.
CharacterStream classes are also divided into Reader classes and Writer
classes. The SuperMost classes for all the InputStream classes is
java.io.InputStream and for all the output stream classes is
java.io.OutPutStream. Similarly, for all the reader classes, the
super-most class is java.io.Reader, and for all the writer classes, it
is java.io.Writer.
