The Object is the real-time entity having some state and behavior. In
Java, Object is an instance of the class having the instance variables
as the state of the object and the methods as the behavior of the
object. The object of a class can be created by using the new keyword.

An object has three characteristics:

-   State

-   Behavior

-   Identity

An object is created using the 'new' keyword. For example:

ClassName obj = new ClassName();
