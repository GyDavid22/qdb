To run Java, you can download two types of frameworks. They are JDK
(Java Development Kit) and JRE (Java Runtime Environment). What they
have in common is that they are both platform-specific software.
However, they have different purposes, JDK includes components for
development and debugging, while JRE is the end-user version, which only
installs what is needed to run the application. JDK comes in 3 editions:
Standard, Enterprise, Micro.
