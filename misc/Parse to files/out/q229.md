Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and
showing only functionality to the user. It displays just the essential
things to the user and hides the internal information, for example,
sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't
know the internal processing about the message delivery. Abstraction
enables you to focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

In Java, there are two ways to achieve the abstraction.
