String pool is the space reserved in the heap memory that can be used to
store the strings. The main advantage of using the String pool is
whenever we create a string literal; the JVM checks the \"string
constant pool\" first. If the string already exists in the pool, a
reference to the pooled instance is returned. If the string doesn't
exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the
pool. Therefore, it saves the memory by avoiding the duplicacy.
