public void fooBarMethod(String\... variables){

// method code

}

-   Ability to provide \... is a feature called varargs (variable
arguments) which was introduced as part of Java 5.

-   The function having \... in the above example indicates that it can
receive multiple arguments of the datatype String.

-   For example, the fooBarMethod can be called in multiple ways and we
can still have one method to process the data as shown below:

fooBarMethod(\"foo\", \"bar\");

fooBarMethod(\"foo\", \"bar\", \"boo\");

fooBarMethod(new String\[\]{\"foo\", \"var\", \"boo\"});

public void myMethod(String\... variables){

for(String variable : variables){

> // business logic

}

}
