The \"finally\" block is used to execute the important code of the
program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not. In other
words, we can say that finally block is the block which is always
executed. Finally block follows try or catch block. If you don't handle
the exception, before terminating the program, JVM runs finally block,
(if any). The finally block is mainly used to place the cleanup code
such as closing a file or closing a connection. Here, we must know that
for each try block there can be zero or more catch blocks, but only one
finally block. The finally block will not be executed if program
exits(either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that
causes the process to abort).
