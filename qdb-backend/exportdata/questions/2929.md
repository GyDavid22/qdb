Although both HashSet and TreeSet are not synchronized and ensure that
duplicates are not present, there are certain properties that
distinguish a HashSet from a TreeSet.

- Implementation: For a HashSet, the hash table is utilized for
  storing the elements in an unordered manner. However, TreeSet makes
  use of the red-black tree to store the elements in a sorted manner.

- Complexity/ Performance: For adding, retrieving, and deleting
  elements, the time amortized complexity is O(1) for a HashSet. The
  time complexity for performing the same operations is a bit higher
  for TreeSet and is equal to O(log n). Overall, the performance of
  HashSet is faster in comparison to TreeSet.

- Methods: hashCode() and equals() are the methods utilized by HashSet
  for making comparisons between the objects. Conversely, compareTo()
  and compare() methods are utilized by TreeSet to facilitate object
  comparisons.

- Objects type: Heterogeneous and null objects can be stored with the
  help of HashSet. In the case of a TreeSet, runtime exception occurs
  while inserting heterogeneous objects or null objects.
