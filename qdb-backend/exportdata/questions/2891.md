They are part of the observer design pattern, Java has a predefined
abstract class and an interface to implement it. Observable classes can
be subscribed to and this class keeps track of the subscribed Observer
objects. When the observable class changes, it calls the update() method
of each subscribed observers, which then do their operations.
