Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs is a programming style that is
associated with concepts like:

- Inheritance: Inheritance is a process where one class acquires the
  properties of another.

- Encapsulation: Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping up
  the data and code together as a single unit.

- Abstraction: Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the
  implementation details from the user and only providing the
  functionality to the users.

- Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or
  object to take multiple forms.
