Polymorphism means many forms.

A single object can refer to the super-class or sub-class depending on
the reference type which is called polymorphism.

Example:

Public class Manipulation() { //Super class

> public void add() {}

}

public class Addition extends Manipulation() { // Sub class

> public void add() {}

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > Manipulation addition = new Addition(); //Manipulation is reference
> > type and Addition is reference type

> > addition.add();

> }

}

Using the Manipulation reference type we can call the Addition class
"add()" method. This ability is known as Polymorphism. Polymorphism is
applicable for overriding and not for overloading.
