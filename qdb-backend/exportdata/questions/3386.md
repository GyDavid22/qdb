Java 15 added the text blocks feature. You can create multiline strings
using text blocks. The multiline string has to be written inside of a
pair of triple-double quotes, as shown in the following example:

String textBlock = \"\"\"

> > Hi

> > Hello

> > Yes\"\"\";

It's the same as creating a string, such as \\nHi\\nHello\\nYes.
