Enlisted below are the three Exception Handling Keywords:

- try:

> When a risky code is surrounded by a try block. An exception occurring
> in the try block is caught by a catch block. Try can be followed
> either by catch (or) finally (or) both. But any one of the blocks is
> mandatory.

- catch:

> This is followed by a try block. Exceptions are caught here.

- finally:

> This is followed either by try block (or) catch block. This block gets
> executed regardless of an exception. So generally clean up codes are
> provided here.
