DispatcherServlet is basically the front controller in the Spring MVC
application as it loads the spring bean configuration file and
initializes all the beans that have been configured. If annotations are
enabled, it also scans the packages to configure any bean annotated with
\@Component, \@Controller, \@Repository or \@Service annotations.

ContextLoaderListener, on the other hand, is the listener to start up
and shut down the WebApplicationContext in Spring root. Some of its
important functions includes tying up the lifecycle of Application
Context to the lifecycle of the ServletContext and automating the
creation of ApplicationContext.
