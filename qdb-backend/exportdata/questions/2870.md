There are two types of constructors in Java.

Parameterized Constructors: Parameterized constructor accepts the
parameters with which users can initialize the instance variables. Users
can initialize the class variables dynamically at the time of
instantiating the class.

Default constructors: This type doesn't accept any parameters; rather,
it instantiates the class variables with their default values. It is
used mainly for object creation.
