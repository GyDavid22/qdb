There are various advantages of defining packages in Java.

- Packages avoid the name clashes.

- The Package provides easier access control.

- We can also have the hidden classes that are not visible outside and
  used by the package.

- It is easier to locate the related classes.

- Packages enable the developer to organize the similar classes more
  effectively. For example, one can clearly understand that the
  classes present in java.io package are used to perform io related
  operations.
