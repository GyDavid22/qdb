> There are two ways to create a thread:

- Extending Thread class

- This creates a thread by creating an instance of a new class
  that extends the Thread class. The extending class must override
  the run() function, which is the thread's entry point.

- Implementing Runnable interface

- This is the easiest way to create a thread, by creating a class
  that implements the runnable interface. After implementing the
  runnable interface, the class must implement the public void
  run() method ()

> The run() method creates a parallel thread in your programme. When
> run() returns, the thread will come to an end.
>
> Within the run() method, you must specify the thread's code.
>
> Like any other method, the run() method can call other methods, use
> other classes, and define variables.
