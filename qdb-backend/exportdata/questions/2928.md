In Java, you cannot override a static method. However, you can override
a private method in a subclass if you create a similar method with the
same return type and method arguments; this is known as method hiding.
It's important to note that private methods are not directly accessible
in a subclass, so you're essentially creating a new method with the
same name and signature in the subclass. About overriding static
methods, declaration of static methods having the same signature can be
done in the subclass but run time polymorphism cannot take place in such
cases. Overriding or dynamic polymorphism occurs during the runtime, but
the static methods are loaded and looked up at the compile time
statically. Hence, these methods can't be overridden.
