The ResultSet object represents a row of a table. It can be used to
change the cursor pointer and get the information from the database. By
default, ResultSet object can move in the forward direction only and is
not updatable. However, we can make this object to move the forward and
backward direction by passing either TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE or
TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE in createStatement(int, int) method.
