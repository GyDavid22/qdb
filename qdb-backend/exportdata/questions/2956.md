StringBuffer is mutable and dynamic in nature whereas String is
immutable. Every updation / modification of String creates a new String
thereby overloading the string pool with unnecessary objects. Hence, in
the cases of a lot of updates, it is always preferred to use
StringBuffer as it will reduce the overhead of the creation of multiple
String objects in the string pool.
