If a method or class object can be used by multiple threads at a time
without any race condition, then the class is thread-safe. Thread safety
is used to make a program safe to use in multithreaded programming. It
can be achieved by the following ways:

- Synchronization

- Using Volatile keyword

- Using a lock based mechanism

- Use of atomic wrapper classes
