Serialization in Java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object
into a byte stream. It is used primarily in Hibernate, RMI, JPA, EJB and
JMS technologies. It is mainly used to travel object's state on the
network (which is known as marshaling). Serializable interface is used
to perform serialization. It is helpful when you require to save the
state of a program to storage such as the file. At a later point of
time, the content of this file can be restored using deserialization. It
is also required to implement RMI(Remote Method Invocation). With the
help of RMI, it is possible to invoke the method of a Java object on one
machine to another machine.
