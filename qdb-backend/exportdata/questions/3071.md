We can create an immutable class by defining a final class having all of
its members as final. Consider the following example.

public final class Employee {

> final String pancardNumber;

> public Employee(String pancardNumber) {

> > this.pancardNumber = pancardNumber;

> }

> public String getPancardNumber() {

> > return pancardNumber;

> }

}
