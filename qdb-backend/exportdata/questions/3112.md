Deserialization is the process of reconstructing the object from the
serialized state. It is the reverse operation of serialization. An
ObjectInputStream deserializes objects and primitive data written using
an ObjectOutputStream.

import java.io.\*;

class Depersist {

> public static void main(String args\[\]) throws Exception {

> > ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new
> > FileInputStream(\"f.txt\"));

> > Student s = (Student) in .readObject();

> > System.out.println(s.id + \" \" + s.name);

> > in .close();

> }

}
