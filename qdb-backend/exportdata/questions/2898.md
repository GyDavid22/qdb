FailFast and FailSafe iterators are used in Java Collections.

FailFast iterators do not allow changes to the collection while
iterating. If an element is added or removed during iteration, they
throw a ConcurrentModificationException.

Example: ArrayList, HashMap

On the contrary, FailSafe iterators allow modifications to the
collection. They operate on a cloned copy of the collection, so no
exceptions are thrown even if the collection is modified during
iteration.

Example: CopyOnWriteArrayList
