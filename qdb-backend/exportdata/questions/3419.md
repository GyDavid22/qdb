The += operator implicitly cast the result of addition into the type of
variable used to hold the result. When you add two integral variable
e.g. variable of type byte, short, or int then they are first promoted
to int and them addition happens. If result of addition is more than
maximum value of a then a + b will give compile time error but a += b
will be ok as shown below

byte a = 127;

byte b = 127;

b = a + b; // error : cannot convert from int to byte

b += a; // ok
