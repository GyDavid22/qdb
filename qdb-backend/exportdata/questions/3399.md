Volatile variables provide the guarantee about ordering and visibility
e.g. volatile assignment cannot be re-ordered with other statements but
in the absence of any synchronization instruction compiler, JVM or JIT
are free to reorder statements for better performance. volatile also
provides the happens-before guarantee which ensures changes made in one
thread is visible to others.

In some cases volatile also provide atomicity e.g. reading 64-bit data
types like long and double are not atomic but read of volatile double or
long is atomic.
