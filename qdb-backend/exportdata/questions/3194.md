> }

> static class Thread implements Runnable {

> > public void run() {

> > > try {

> > > > Long duration = (long)(Math.random() \* 5);

> > > > System.out.println(\"Running Thread!\");

> > > > TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(duration);

> > > > System.out.println(\"Thread Completed\");

> > > } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
