There are the following main disadvantages of using inner classes.

- Inner classes increase the total number of classes used by the
  developer and therefore increases the workload of JVM since it has
  to perform some routine operations for those extra classes which
  result in slower performance.

- IDEs provide less support to the inner classes as compare to the top
  level classes and therefore it annoys the developers while working
  with inner classes.
