- The Atomic action is the operation which can be performed in a
  single unit of a task without any interference of the other
  operations.

- The Atomic action cannot be stopped in between the task. Once
  started it fill stop after the completion of the task only.

- An increment operation such as a++ does not allow an atomic action.

- All reads and writes operation for the primitive variable (except
  long and double) are the atomic operation.

- All reads and writes operation for the volatile variable (including
  long and double) are the atomic operation.

- The Atomic methods are available in java.util.Concurrent package.
