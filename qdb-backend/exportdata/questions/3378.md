The String class doesn't have a method to remove characters. The
following example code shows how to use the replace() method to create a
new string without the given character:

String str1 = \"abcdABCDabcdABCD\";

str1 = str1.replace(\"a\", \"\");

System.out.println(str1); // bcdABCDbcdABCD

String is immutable in Java. All the string manipulation methods return
a new string, which is why you need to assign it to another variable.
