Data encapsulation is one of the properties of OOP concepts, where all
the data such as variables and methods are enclosed together as a single
unit. It helps developers to follow modularity while developing software
by ensuring that each object is independent of other objects by having
its own methods, attributes, and functionalities. It is used for the
security of the private properties of an object and hence serves the
purpose of data hiding.

We can achieve encapsulation in Java by:

- Declaring the variables of a class as private.

- Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the
  values of the variables.
