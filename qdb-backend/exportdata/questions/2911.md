To copy the object's data, we have several methods like deep copy and
shallow copy.

Example:

class Rectangle{

int length = 5;

> int breadth = 3;

}

Object for this Rectangle class - Rectangle obj1 = new Rectangle();

Shallow copy - The shallow copy only creates a new reference and points
to the same object. Example: for Shallow copy, we can do this by:

Rectangle obj2 = obj1;

Now by doing this what will happen is the new reference is created with
the name obj2 and that will point to the same memory location.

Deep Copy - In a deep copy, we create a new object and copy the old
object value to the new object. Example:

Rectangle obj3 = new Rectangle();

Obj3.length = obj1.length;

Obj3.breadth = obj1.breadth;

Both these objects will point to the memory location as stated below:
