We can convert an Array to ArrayList by using the asList() method of
Arrays class. asList() method is the static method of Arrays class and
accepts the List object. Consider the following syntax:

Arrays.asList(item)

We can convert an ArrayList to Array using toArray() method of the
ArrayList class. Consider the following syntax to convert the ArrayList
to the List object.

List_object.toArray(new String\[List_object.size()\])
