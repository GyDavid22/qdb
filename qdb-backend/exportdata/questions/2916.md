One approach to not allow serialization of attributes of a class in Java
is by using writeObject() and readObject() methods in the subclass and
throwing a not Serializable exception.

Other, probably better approach is the following:

In order to achieve this, the attribute can be declared along with the
usage of transient keyword as shown below:

public class InterviewBitExample {

private transient String someInfo;

private String name;

private int id;

// :

// Getters setters

// :

}

In the above example, all the fields except someInfo can be serialized.
