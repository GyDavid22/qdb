- Static Methods and Static variables are those methods and variables
  that belong to the class of the java program, not to the object of
  the class. This gets memory where the class is loaded. And these can
  directly be called with the help of class names.

- For example - We have used mathematical functions in the java
  program like - max(), min(), sqrt(), pow(), etc. And if we
  notice that, then we will find that we call it directly with the
  class name. Like - Math.max(), Math.min(), etc. So that is a
  static method. And Similarly static variables we have used like
  (length) for the array to get the length. So that is the static
  method.

- Static classes - A class in the java program cannot be static except
  if it is the inner class. If it is an inner static class, then it
  exactly works like other static members of the class.
