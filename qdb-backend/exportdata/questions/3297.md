Two types of transaction management are supported by Spring. They are:

- Programmatic transaction management: In this, the transaction is
  managed with the help of programming. It provides you extreme
  flexibility, but it is very difficult to maintain.

- Declarative transaction management: In this, transaction management
  is separated from the business code. Only annotations or XML based
  configurations are used to manage the transactions.
