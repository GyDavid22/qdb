- The process of communication between synchronized threads is termed
  as inter-thread communication.

- Inter-thread communication is used to avoid thread polling in Java.

- The thread is paused running in its critical section, and another
  thread is allowed to enter (or lock) in the same critical section to
  be executed.

- It can be obtained by wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods.
