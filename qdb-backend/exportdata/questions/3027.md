No, because method overriding is used to achieve runtime polymorphism
and data members cannot be overridden. We can override the member
functions but not the data members. Consider the example given below.

class Bike {

> int speedlimit = 90;

}

class Honda3 extends Bike {

> int speedlimit = 150;

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > Bike obj = new Honda3();

> > System.out.println(obj.speedlimit); //90

> }

}

Output:

90
