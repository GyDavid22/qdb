The wait() method is provided by the Object class in Java. This method
is used for inter-thread communication in Java. The
java.lang.Object.wait() is used to pause the current thread, and wait
until another thread does not call the notify() or notifyAll() method.
Its syntax is given below.

public final void wait()

wait () method is used to make the thread to wait in the waiting pool.
When the wait () method is executed during a thread execution then
immediately the thread gives up the lock on the object and goes to the
waiting pool. Wait () method tells the thread to wait for a given amount
of time.

Then the thread will wake up after notify () (or) notify all () method
is called.

Wait() and the other above-mentioned methods do not give the lock on the
object immediately until the currently executing thread completes the
synchronized code. It is mostly used in synchronization.

Example:

public static void main(String\[\] args) {

> Thread t = new Thread();

> t.start();

> Synchronized(t) {

> > Wait();

> }

}
