Method overloading is the polymorphism technique which allows us to
create multiple methods with the same name but different signature. We
can achieve method overloading in two ways.

- By Changing the number of arguments

- By Changing the data type of arguments

Method overloading increases the readability of the program. Method
overloading is performed to figure out the program quickly.
