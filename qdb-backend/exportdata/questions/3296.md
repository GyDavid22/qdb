We can use Spring ORM module to integrate Spring and Hibernate
frameworks if you are using Hibernate 3+ where SessionFactory provides
current session, then you should avoid using HibernateTemplate or
HibernateDaoSupport classes and better to use DAO pattern with
dependency injection for the integration.

Also, Spring ORM provides support for using Spring declarative
transaction management, so you should utilize that rather than going for
hibernate boiler-plate code for transaction management.
