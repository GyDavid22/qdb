There are the following steps that are performed when two computers
connect through TCP.

- The ServerSocket object is instantiated by the server which denotes
  the port number to which, the connection will be made.

- After instantiating the ServerSocket object, the server invokes
  accept() method of ServerSocket class which makes server wait until
  the client attempts to connect to the server on the given port.

- Meanwhile, the server is waiting, a socket is created by the client
  by instantiating Socket class. The socket class constructor accepts
  the server port number and server name.

- The Socket class constructor attempts to connect with the server on
  the specified name. If the connection is established, the client
  will have a socket object that can communicate with the server.

- The accept() method invoked by the server returns a reference to the
  new socket on the server that is connected with the server.
