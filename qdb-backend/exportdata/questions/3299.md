Some of the important benefits of using hibernate framework are:

- Hibernate eliminates all the boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC
  and takes care of managing resources, so we can focus on business
  logic.

- Hibernate framework provides support for XML as well as JPA
  annotations, that makes our code implementation independent.

- Hibernate provides a powerful query language (HQL) that is similar
  to SQL. However, HQL is fully object-oriented and understands
  concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and association.

- Hibernate is an open source project from Red Hat Community and used
  worldwide. This makes it a better choice than others because
  learning curve is small and there are tons of online documentation
  and help is easily available in forums.

- Hibernate is easy to integrate with other Java EE frameworks, it's
  so popular that Spring Framework provides built-in support for
  integrating hibernate with Spring applications.

- Hibernate supports lazy initialization using proxy objects and
  perform actual database queries only when it's required.

- Hibernate cache helps us in getting better performance.

- For database vendor specific feature, hibernate is suitable because
  we can also execute native sql queries.

Overall hibernate is the best choice in current market for ORM tool, it
contains all the features that you will ever need in an ORM tool.
