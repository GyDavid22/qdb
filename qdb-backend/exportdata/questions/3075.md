Metacharacters have the special meaning to the regular expression
engine. The metacharacters are \^, \$, ., \*, +, etc. The regular
expression engine does not consider them as the regular characters. To
enable the regular expression engine treating the metacharacters as
ordinary characters, we need to escape the metacharacters with the
backslash.
