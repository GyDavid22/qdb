Yes, Java allows to save our java file by .java only, we need to compile
it by javac .java and run by java classname Let's take a simple
example:

//save by .java only

class A {

> public static void main(String args\[\]){

> > System.out.println(\"Hello java\");

> }

}

compile it by javac .java

run it by java A
