- String Literal

Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example:

String s=\"welcome\";

Each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the \"string
constant pool\" first. If the string already exists in the pool, a
reference to the pooled instance is returned. If the string doesn't
exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the
pool. String objects are stored in a special memory area known as the
string constant pool For example:

String s1=\"Welcome\";

String s2=\"Welcome\";//It doesn't create a new instance

- By new keyword

String s=new String(\"Welcome\");//creates two objects and one reference
variable

In such case, JVM will create a new string object in normal (non-pool)
heap memory, and the literal \"Welcome\" will be placed in the constant
string pool. The variable s will refer to the object in a heap
(non-pool).
