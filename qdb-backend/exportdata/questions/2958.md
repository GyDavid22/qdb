In java multithreading, the main() threads are always non-daemon
threads. And there is no way we can change the nature of the non-daemon
thread to the daemon thread. If we tried with the following code
snippet, an IllegalThreadStateException would be thrown:

public static void main(String\[\] args) {

> Thread current = Thread.currentThread();

> current.setDaemon(true);

}
