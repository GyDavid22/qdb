The following example code shows how to create a basic enum:

public enum ThreadStates {

> START,

> RUNNING,

> WAITING,

> DEAD;

}

ThreadStates is the enum with fixed constants fields START, RUNNING,
WAITING, and DEAD. All enums implicitly extend the java.lang.Enum class
and implement the Serializable and Comparable interfaces. Enum can have
methods also.
