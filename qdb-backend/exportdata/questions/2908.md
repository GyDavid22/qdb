That's because a code inside a try block might be able to throw multiple
types of exceptions and we would like to handle them differently. See
this example:

public class Example {

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > try {

> > > int a\[\] = new int\[10\];

> > > a\[10\] = 10 / 0;

> > } catch (ArithmeticException e) {

> > > System.out.println(\"Arithmetic exception in first catch block\");

> > } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {

> > > System.out.println(\"Array index out of bounds in second catch
> > > block\");

> > } catch (Exception e) {

> > > System.out.println(\"Any exception in third catch block\");

> > }

> }

}
