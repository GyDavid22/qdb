The Thread can be created by using two ways.

- By extending the Thread class

- By implementing the Runnable interface

However, the primary differences between both the ways are given below:

- By extending the Thread class, we cannot extend any other class, as
  Java does not allow multiple inheritances while implementing the
  Runnable interface; we can also extend other base class(if
  required).

- By extending the Thread class, each of thread creates the unique
  object and associates with it while implementing the Runnable
  interface; multiple threads share the same object

- Thread class provides various inbuilt methods such as getPriority(),
  isAlive and many more while the Runnable interface provides a single
  method, i.e., run().
