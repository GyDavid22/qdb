Garbage collection is a process of reclaiming the unused runtime
objects. It is performed for memory management. In other words, we can
say that It is the process of removing unused objects from the memory to
free up space and make this space available for Java Virtual Machine.
Due to garbage collection java gives 0 as output to a variable whose
value is not set, i.e., the variable has been defined but not
initialized. For this purpose, we were using free() function in the C
language and delete() in C++. In Java, it is performed automatically.
So, java provides better memory management.
