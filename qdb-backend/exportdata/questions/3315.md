An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as
OutOfMemory error. These JVM errors you cannot repair them at runtime.
Though error can be caught in the catch block but the execution of
application will come to a halt and is not recoverable.

While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input or human
error etc. e.g. FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified
file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you
try using a null reference. In most of the cases it is possible to
recover from an exception (probably by giving the user feedback for
entering proper values etc.
