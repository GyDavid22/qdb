Composition, and Aggregation help to build (Has - A - Relationship)
between classes and objects. But both are not the same in the end. Let's
understand with the help of an example.

- Consider the University as a class that has some departments in it.
  So the university will be the container object. And departments in
  it will contain objects. Now in this case, if the container object
  destroys then the contained objects will also get destroyed
  automatically. So here we can say that there is a strong association
  between the objects. So this Strong Association is called
  Composition.

- Now consider one more example. Suppose we have a class department
  and there are several professors' objects there in the department.
  Now if the department class is destroyed then the professor's
  object will become free to bind with other objects. Because
  container objects (Department) only hold the references of contained
  objects (Professor's). So here is the weak association between the
  objects. And this weak association is called Aggregation.
