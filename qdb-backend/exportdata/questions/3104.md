In Java, FilePermission class is used to alter the permissions set on a
file. Java FilePermission class contains the permission related to a
directory or file. All the permissions are related to the path. The path
can be of two types:

D:\\\\IO\\\\-: It indicates that the permission is associated with all
subdirectories and files recursively.

D:\\\\IO\\\\\*: It indicates that the permission is associated with all
directory and files within this directory excluding subdirectories.

Let's see the simple example in which permission of a directory path is
granted with read permission and a file of this directory is granted for
write permission.

package com.javatpoint;

import java.io.\*;

import java.security.PermissionCollection;

public class FilePermissionExample {

> public static void main(String\[\] args) throws IOException {

> > String srg = \"D:\\\\IO Package\\\\java.txt\";

> > FilePermission file1 = new FilePermission(\"D:\\\\IO Package\\\\-\",
> > \"read\");

> > PermissionCollection permission = file1.newPermissionCollection();

> > permission.add(file1);

> > FilePermission file2 = new FilePermission(srg, \"write\");

> > permission.add(file2);

> > if (permission.implies(new FilePermission(srg, \"read,write\"))) {

> > > System.out.println(\"Read, Write permission is granted for the
> > > path \" + srg);

> > } else {

> > > System.out.println(\"No Read, Write permission is granted for the
> > > path \" + srg);

> > }

> }

}

Output

Read, Write permission is granted for the path D:\\IO Package\\java.txt
