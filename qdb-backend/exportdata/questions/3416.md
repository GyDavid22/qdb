No. The reason for that is because C is a derivative of B. If we could
cast B into C then the parts of C "would be missing" from B, for
instance, if we called a method or modified a variable which exists in C
but not in B there would be nothing to call or modify. So as a result,
casting a parent class to a derivative class would result in a
compile-time error.
