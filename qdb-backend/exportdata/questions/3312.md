Java Design patterns can be broadly categorized into three main
categories: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral
patterns. Let's explore each category in more detail:

- Creational Patterns: These patterns deal with object creation
  mechanisms, providing ways to create objects in a flexible and
  reusable manner. Some common creational patterns include:

- Singleton: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created
  and provides a global point of access to it.

- Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating objects, but
  lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

- Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of
  related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete
  classes.

- Structural Patterns: These patterns focus on the composition of
  classes and objects, defining how they can be structured to form
  larger structures while keeping the system flexible and efficient.
  Some examples of structural patterns include:

- Adapter: Converts the interface of a class into another
  interface that clients expect.

- Decorator: Dynamically adds new behaviors or responsibilities to
  an object.

- Composite: Treats a group of objects as a single object,
  allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions
  uniformly.

- Behavioral Patterns: These patterns address the interaction and
  communication between objects, defining how they collaborate and
  fulfill their responsibilities. Some common behavioral patterns are:

- Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so
  that when one object changes state, all its dependents are
  notified and updated automatically.

- Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
  and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

- Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to
  parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.

These divisions offer a methodical approach to categorize and comprehend
many Java design patterns. It is noteworthy that certain design patterns
might fall into more than one category or have variants and
combinations, and that these categories are not exclusive of one
another. Other design patterns that fall outside of these categories
include concurrency patterns and architectural patterns, both of which
are applicable to Java programming.
