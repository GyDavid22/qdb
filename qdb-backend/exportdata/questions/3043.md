A class can be made read-only by making all of the fields private. The
read-only class will have only getter methods which return the private
property of the class to the main method. We cannot modify this property
because there is no setter method available in the class. Consider the
following example.

//A Java class which has only getter methods.>

public class Student {

> //private data member>

> private String college = \"AKG\";

> //getter method for college>

> public String getCollege() {

> > return college;

> }

}
