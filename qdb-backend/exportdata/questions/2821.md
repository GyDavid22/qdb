A package is a group of similar type of classes, interfaces, and
sub-packages. It provides access protection and removes naming
collision. The packages in Java can be categorized into two forms,
inbuilt package, and user-defined package. There are many built-in
packages such as Java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql, etc.
Consider the following example to create a package in Java.

//save as Simple.java

package mypack;

public class Simple {

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > System.out.println(\"Welcome to package\");

> }

}
