'IS-A' relationship is another name for inheritance. When we inherit the
base class from the derived class, then it forms a relationship between
the classes. So that relationship is termed an 'IS-A' Relationship.

Example: Consider a Television (Typical CRT TV). Now another Smart TV
that is inherited from television class. So we can say that the Smart iv
is also a TV. Because CRT TV things can also be done in the Smart TV.
