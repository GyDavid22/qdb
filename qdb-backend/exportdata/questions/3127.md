Advantages of Object Cloning

- You don't need to write lengthy and repetitive codes. Just use an
  abstract class with a 4- or 5-line long clone() method.

- It is the easiest and most efficient way of copying objects,
  especially if we are applying it to an already developed or an old
  project. Just define a parent class, implement Cloneable in it,
  provide the definition of the clone() method and the task will be
  done.

- Clone() is the fastest way to copy the array.

Disadvantages of Object Cloning

- To use the Object.clone() method, we have to change many syntaxes to
  our code, like implementing a Cloneable interface, defining the
  clone() method and handling CloneNotSupportedException, and finally,
  calling Object.clone(), etc.

- We have to implement the Cloneable interface while it does not have
  any methods in it. We have to use it to tell the JVM that we can
  perform a clone() on our object.

- Object.clone() is protected, so we have to provide our own clone()
  and indirectly call Object.clone() from it.

- Object.clone() does not invoke any constructor, so we do not have
  any control over object construction.

- If you want to write a clone method in a child class, then all of
  its superclasses should define the clone() method in them or inherit
  it from another parent class. Otherwise, the super.clone() chain
  will fail.

- Object.clone() supports only shallow copying, but we will need to
  override it if we need deep cloning.
