public static final variables are also known as a compile time constant,
the public is optional there. They are replaced with actual values at
compile time because compiler know their value up-front and also knows
that it cannot be changed during run-time.

One of the problem with this is that if you happened to use a public
static final variable from some in-house or third party library and
their value changed later than your client will still be using old value
even after you deploy a new version of JARs. To avoid that, make sure
you compile your program when you upgrade dependency JAR files
