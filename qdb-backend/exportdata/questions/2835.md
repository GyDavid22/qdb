That's because with arrays, the containing variable is a reference to
the beginning of the array. The indexing is an offset from the
beginning, so it starts with 0 because the first element in an array is
right at the beginning.

This way the 0 index array avoids the extra arithmetic operation to
calculate the memory address.

Example - Consider the array and assume each element takes 4-byte memory
space. Then the address will be like this:

![](image11.png){}

Now if we want to access index 4. Then internally java calculates the
address using the formula:

\[Base Address + (index \* no_of_bytes)\]. So according to this. The
starting address of the index 4 will be - \[100 + (4\*4)\] = 116. And
exactly that's what the address is calculated.

Now consider the same with 1 index Array:

![](image12.png){}

Now if we apply the same formula here. Then we get - 116 as the starting
address of the 4th index. Which is wrong. Then we need to apply
formula - \[Base Address + ((index-1) \* no_of_bytes)\].

And for calculating this, an extra arithmetic operation has to be
performed. And consider the case where millions of addresses need to be
calculated, this causes complexity. So to avoid this, ) the index array
is supported by java.
