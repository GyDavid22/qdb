A final variable, not initialized at the time of declaration, is known
as the final blank variable. We can't initialize the final blank
variable directly. Instead, we have to initialize it by using the class
constructor. If it is static blank final variable, it can be initialized
only in the static block. It is useful in the case when the user has
some data which must not be changed by others, for example, PAN Number.
Consider the following example:

class Student {

> int id;

> String name;

> final String PAN_CARD_NUMBER;

> \...

}
