The nested class can be defined as the class which is defined inside
another class or interface. We use the nested class to logically group
classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and
maintainable. A nested class can access all the data members of the
outer class including private data members and methods. The syntax of
the nested class is defined below.

class Java_Outer_class {

> //code>

> class Java_Nested_class {

> > //code>

> }

}

There are two types of nested classes, static nested class, and
non-static nested class. The non-static nested class can also be called
as inner-class.
