No, this cannot be assigned to any value because it always points to the
current class object and this is the final reference in Java. However,
if we try to do so, the compiler error will be shown. Consider the
following example.

public class Test {

> public Test() {

> > this = null;

> > System.out.println(\"Test class constructor called\");

> }

> public static void main (String args\[\]) {

> > Test t = new Test();

> }

}

Output

Test.java:5: error: cannot assign a value to final variable this

> > this = null;

> > \^
