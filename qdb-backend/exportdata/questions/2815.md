In Java, a marker interface is an interface that does not declare any
methods or fields. Its sole purpose is to mark or tag a class as having
a certain characteristic or capability. By implementing a marker
interface, a class indicates that it possesses specific behavior or
qualifies for a particular treatment.

Marker interfaces are purely a convention and serve as a form of
metadata. They provide a way for developers or frameworks to identify
classes that meet certain criteria without requiring any additional
methods or fields.

Some common examples of marker interfaces in Java include:

- Serializable: The Serializable interface is a marker interface that
  indicates a class can be serialized, allowing objects of that class
  to be converted into a byte stream for storage or transmission.

- Cloneable: The Cloneable interface is a marker interface that
  indicates a class can be cloned using the \`clone()\` method.
  Implementing this interface allows for creating a copy of an object.

- Remote: The Remote interface is a marker interface used in Java's
  Remote Method Invocation (RMI) framework. It marks an interface that
  can be invoked remotely, enabling the execution of methods across
  different JVMs.

Marker interfaces can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

- Providing hints to the Java runtime or frameworks about special
  handling or optimizations for certain classes.

- Enabling conditional behavior based on the presence of a marker
  interface during runtime.

- Supporting integration with external libraries or frameworks that
  recognize and operate on marker interfaces.

It's important to note that with the introduction of annotations in
Java, the use of marker interfaces has become less common. Annotations
offer a more flexible and expressive way to attach metadata to classes
and methods. However, marker interfaces still have their place in
certain contexts and are part of the Java language's design and
heritage.

The marker interface can be declared as follows.

public interface Serializable {

}
