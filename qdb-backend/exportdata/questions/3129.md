Java strictfp keyword ensures that you will get the same result on every
platform if you perform operations in the floating-point variable. The
precision may differ from platform to platform that is why java
programming language has provided the strictfp keyword so that you get
the same result on every platform. So, now you have better control over
the floating-point arithmetic.

It can be used for classes, methods or interfaces. Example:

public strictfp class ScientificCalculator {

> public double sum(double value1, double value2) {

> > return value1 + value2;

> }

> public double diff(double value1, double value2) {

> > return value1 - value2;

> }

}

public strictfp void calculateMarksPercentage() {

> \...

}

public strictfp interface Circle {

> double computeArea(double radius);

}
