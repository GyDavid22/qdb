The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer
to the immediate parent class object. Whenever you create the instance
of the subclass, an instance of the parent class is created implicitly
which is referred by super reference variable. The super() is called in
the class constructor implicitly by the compiler if there is no super or
this.

class Animal {

> Animal() {

> > System.out.println(\"animal is created\");

> }

}

class Dog extends Animal {

> Dog() {

> > System.out.println(\"dog is created\");

> }

}

class TestSuper4 {

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > Dog d = new Dog();

> }

}

Output:

animal is created

dog is created
