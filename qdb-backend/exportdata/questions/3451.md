This is similar to the previous question and you can use the answer
given there. Particularly with thread, you should:

- name your thread

- keep your task and thread separate, use Runnable or Callable with
  thread pool executor.

- use thread pool

- use volatile to indicate compiler about ordering, visibility, and
  atomicity.

- avoid thread local variable because incorrect use of ThreadLocal
  class in Java can create a memory leak.
