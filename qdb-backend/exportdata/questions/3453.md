Another good Java best practices for experienced Java developer of 7 to
8 years experience. Why it's important? because they are the ones which
set the trend in the code and educate junior developers. There are many
best practices and you can name as per your comfort and convenience.
Here are some of the more common ones:

- use batch statement for inserting and updating data.

- use PreparedStatement to avoid SQL exception and better performance.

- use database connection pool

- access resultset using column name instead of column indexes.

- Don't generate dynamic SQL by concatenating String with user input.
