Ordered: It means the values that are stored in a collection is based on
the values that are added to the collection. So we can iterate the
values from the collection in a specific order.

Sorted: Sorting mechanisms can be applied internally or externally so
that the group of objects sorted in a particular collection is based on
the properties of the objects.
