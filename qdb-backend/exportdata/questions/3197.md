The Callable interface and Runnable interface both are used by the
classes which wanted to execute with multiple threads. However, there
are two main differences between the both :

- A Callable \<V\> interface can return a result, whereas the Runnable
  interface cannot return any result.

- A Callable \<V\> interface can throw a checked exception, whereas
  the Runnable interface cannot throw checked exception.

- A Callable \<V\> interface cannot be used before the Java 5 whereas
  the Runnable interface can be used.
