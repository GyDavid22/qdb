The gc() method is used to invoke the garbage collector for cleanup
processing. This method is found in System and Runtime classes. This
function explicitly makes the Java Virtual Machine free up the space
occupied by the unused objects so that it can be utilized or reused.
Consider the following example for the better understanding of how the
gc() method invoke the garbage collector.

public class TestGarbage1 {

> public void finalize() {

> > System.out.println(\"object is garbage collected\");

> }

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > TestGarbage1 s1 = new TestGarbage1();

> > TestGarbage1 s2 = new TestGarbage1();

> > s1 = null;

> > s2 = null;

> > System.gc();

> }

}

Output:

object is garbage collected

object is garbage collected
