In Java, constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor
from another with respect to the current object. Constructor chaining is
possible only through legacy where a subclass constructor is responsible
for invoking the superclass' constructor first. There could be any
number of classes in the constructor chain. Constructor chaining can be
achieved in two ways:

- Within the same class using this()

- From base class using super()
