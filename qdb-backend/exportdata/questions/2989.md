The static variable is used to refer to the common property of all
objects (that is not unique for each object), e.g., The company name of
employees, college name of students, etc. Static variable gets memory
only once in the class area at the time of class loading. Using a static
variable makes your program more memory efficient (it saves memory).
Static variable belongs to the class rather than the object.

//Program of static variable

class Student8 {

int rollno;

String name;

static String college =\"ITS\";

>

Student8(int r,String n){

rollno = r;

name = n;

}

void display (){System.out.println(rollno+\" \"+name+\" \"+college);

}

public static void main(String args\[\]) {

Student8 s1 = new Student8(111,\"Karan\");

Student8 s2 = new Student8(222,\"Aryan\");

s1.display();

s2.display();

}

}

Output:

111 Karan ITS

222 Aryan ITS
