Directives are instructions processed by JSP Engine. After the JSP page
is compiled into a Servlet, Directives set page-level instructions,
insert external files, and define customized tag libraries. Directives
are defined using the symbols below:

start with \"\< %@\" and then end with \"% \>\"

The various types of directives are shown below:

- Include directive: It includes a file and combines the content of
  the whole file with the currently active pages.

- Page directive: Page Directive defines specific attributes in the
  JSP page, like the buffer and error page.

- Taglib: Taglib declares a custom tag library, which is used on the
  page.
