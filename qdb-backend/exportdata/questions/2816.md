It is the process of creating an exact copy of any object. In order to
support this, a java class has to implement the Cloneable interface of
java.lang package and override the clone() method provided by the Object
class the syntax of which is:

protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {

> return (Object) super.clone();

}

In case the Cloneable interface is not implemented and just the method
is overridden, it results in CloneNotSupportedException in Java.
