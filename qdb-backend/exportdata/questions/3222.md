The hashCode() method returns a hash code value (an integer number).

The hashCode() method returns the same integer number if two keys (by
calling equals() method) are identical.

However, it is possible that two hash code numbers can have different or
the same keys.

If two objects do not produce an equal result by using the equals()
method, then the hashcode() method will provide the different integer
result for both the objects.
