Session management in Java refers to the process of maintaining a
dynamic state of interaction between a client and a server during a
user's visit to a web application. It involves the exchange of
information, typically in the form of requests and responses, between
the client's web browser and the server. One common approach to
implementing session management is by using a session ID, which is a
unique identifier assigned to each client's communication session and
is exchanged between the client and the server to keep track of the
session's state.
