Multithreading programming has the following advantages:

- Multithreading allows an application/program to be always reactive
  for input, even already running with some background tasks

- Multithreading allows the faster execution of tasks, as threads
  execute independently.

- Multithreading provides better utilization of cache memory as
  threads share the common memory resources.

- Multithreading reduces the number of the required server as one
  server can execute multiple threads at a time.
