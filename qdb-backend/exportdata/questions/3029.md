Output

Test:print() called

Explanation

It is an example of Dynamic method dispatch. The type of reference
variable b is determined at runtime. At compile-time, it is checked
whether that method is present in the Base class. In this case, it is
overridden in the child class, therefore, at runtime the derived class
method is called.
