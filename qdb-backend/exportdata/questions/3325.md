Default: Methods and variables declared in a class without any access
specifiers are called default.

![Default](image125.jpeg){}

Default members in Class A are visible to the other classes which are
inside the package and invisible to the classes which are outside the
package.

So Class A members are visible to Class B and invisible to Class C.

Protected:

![Protected](image126.jpeg){}

Protected is the same as Default but if a class extends then it is
visible even if it is outside the package.

Class A members are visible to Class B because it is inside the package.
For Class C it is invisible but if Class C extends Class A then the
members are visible to Class C even if it is outside the package.
