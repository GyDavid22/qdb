Copy constructor is a member function that is used to initialize an
object using another object of the same class.

There is no copy constructor in java. However, we can copy the values
from one object to another like copy constructor in C++.

There are many ways to copy the values of one object into another in
java. They are:

- By constructor

- By assigning the values of one object into another

- By clone() method of Object class

In this example, we are going to copy the values of one object into
another using java constructor.

//Java program to initialize the values from one object to another

class Student6{

> int id;

> String name;

> //constructor to initialize integer and string

> Student6(int i,String n){

> id = i;

> name = n;

> }

> //constructor to initialize another object

> Student6(Student6 s){

> id = s.id;

> name =s.name;

> }

> void display(){System.out.println(id+\" \"+name);}

> public static void main(String args\[\]){

> Student6 s1 = new Student6(111,\"Karan\");

> Student6 s2 = new Student6(s1);

> s1.display();

> s2.display();

}

}

Output:

111 Karan

111 Karan
