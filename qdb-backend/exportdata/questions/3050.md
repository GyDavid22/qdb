There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here,
an error is considered as the unchecked exception. According to Oracle,
there are three types of exceptions:

- Checked Exception: Checked exceptions are the one which are checked
  at compile-time. For example, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException,
  etc.

- Unchecked Exception: Unchecked exceptions are the one which are
  handled at runtime because they can not be checked at compile-time.
  For example, ArithmaticException, NullPointerException,
  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc.

- Error: Error cause the program to exit since they are not
  recoverable. For Example, OutOfMemoryError, AssertionError, etc.
