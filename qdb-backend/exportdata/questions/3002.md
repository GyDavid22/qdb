Inheritance is a mechanism by which one object acquires all the
properties and behavior of another object of another class. It is used
for Code Reusability and Method Overriding. The idea behind inheritance
in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing
classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods
and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and
fields in your current class also. Inheritance represents the IS-A
relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

There are five types of inheritance in Java.

- Single-level inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits
  the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well
  as one child class.

- Multi-level inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which
  is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than
  one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance
  is called Multilevel Inheritance.

- Multiple Inheritance

- Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child
  classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes
  have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known
  as hierarchical.

- Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or
  more types of inheritance.

Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class.
