Yes, it is possible for the program to go out of memory in spite of the
presence of a garbage collector. Garbage collection assists in
recognizing and eliminating those objects which are not required in the
program anymore, in order to free up the resources used by them.

In a program, if an object is unreachable, then the execution of garbage
collection takes place with respect to that object. If the amount of
memory required for creating a new object is not sufficient, then memory
is released for those objects which are no longer in the scope with the
help of a garbage collector. The memory limit is exceeded for the
program when the memory released is not enough for creating new objects.

Moreover, exhaustion of the heap memory takes place if objects are
created in such a manner that they remain in the scope and consume
memory. The developer should make sure to dereference the object after
its work is accomplished. Although the garbage collector endeavors its
level best to reclaim memory as much as possible, memory limits can
still be exceeded.

Let's take a look at the following example:

List\<String> example = new LinkedList\<String>();

while(true) {

> example.add(new String(\"Memory Limit Exceeded\"));

}
