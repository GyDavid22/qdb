The daemon threads are the low priority threads that provide the
background support and services to the user threads. Daemon thread gets
automatically terminated by the JVM if the program remains with the
daemon thread only, and all other user threads are ended/died. There are
two methods for daemon thread available in the Thread class:

- public void setDaemon(boolean status): It used to mark the thread
  daemon thread or a user thread.

- public boolean isDaemon(): It checks the thread is daemon or not.
