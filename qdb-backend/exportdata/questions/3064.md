The simple meaning of immutable is unmodifiable or unchangeable. In
Java, String is immutable, i.e., once string object has been created,
its value can't be changed. Consider the following example for better
understanding.

class Testimmutablestring {

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > String s = \"Sachin\";

> > s.concat(\" Tendulkar\"); //concat() method appends the string at
> > the end

> > System.out.println(s); //will print Sachin because strings are
> > immutable objects

> }

}

Output:

Sachin
