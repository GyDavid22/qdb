One of the practical use of the volatile variable is to make reading
double and long atomic. Both double and long are 64-bit wide and they
are read in two parts, first 32-bit first time and next 32-bit second
time, which is non-atomic but volatile double and long read is atomic in
Java.

Another use of the volatile variable is to provide a memory barrier,
just like it is used in Disruptor framework. Basically, Java Memory
model inserts a write barrier after you write to a volatile variable and
a read barrier before you read it.

Which means, if you write to volatile field then it's guaranteed that
any thread accessing that variable will see the value you wrote and
anything you did before doing that right into the thread is guaranteed
to have happened and any updated data values will also be visible to all
threads, because the memory barrier flushed all other writes to the
cache.
