PriorityQueue guarantees that lowest or highest priority element always
remain at the head of the queue, but LinkedHashMap maintains the order
on which elements are inserted. When you iterate over a PriorityQueue,
iterator doesn't guarantee any order but iterator of LinkedHashMap does
guarantee the order on which elements are inserted.
