Constructor overloading is the process of creating multiple constructors
in the class consisting of the same name with a difference in the
constructor parameters. Depending upon the number of parameters and
their corresponding types, distinguishing of the different types of
constructors is done by the compiler.

Three constructors are defined here but they differ on the basis of
parameter type and their numbers. There is no limit regarding the number
of created constructors.
