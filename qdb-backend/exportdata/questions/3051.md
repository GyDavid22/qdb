Exception Handling is a mechanism that is used to handle runtime errors.
It is used primarily to handle checked exceptions. Exception handling
maintains the normal flow of the program. There are mainly two types of
exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here, the error is considered as the
unchecked exception.

There are five keywords used to handle exceptions in Java:

- try

- catch

- finally

- throw

- throws

Two different ways to handle exceptions are explained below:

- Using try/catch:

> The risky code is surrounded by try block. If an exception occurs,
> then it is caught by the catch block which is followed by the try
> block.
>
> Example:
>
> class Manipulation {
>
> \>public static void main(String\[\] args) {
>
> \>\>add();
>
> \>}
>
> \>Public void add() {
>
> \>\>try {
>
> \>\>\>addition();
>
> \>\>} catch (Exception e) {
>
> \>\>\>e.printStacktrace();
>
> \>\>}
>
> \>}
>
> }

- By declaring throws keyword:

> At the end of the method, we can declare the exception using throws
> keyword.

> \>public void add() throws Exception {
>
> \>\>addition();
>
> \>}
