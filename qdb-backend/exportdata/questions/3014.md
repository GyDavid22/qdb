Yes, we can change the scope of the overridden method in the subclass.
However, we must notice that we cannot decrease the accessibility of the
method. The following point must be taken care of while changing the
accessibility of the method.

- The private can be changed to protected, public, or default.

- The protected can be changed to public or default.

- The default can be changed to public.

- The public will always remain public.
