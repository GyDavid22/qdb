Anonymous inner classes are the classes that are automatically declared
and instantiated within an expression. We cannot apply different access
modifiers to them. Anonymous class cannot be static, and cannot define
any static fields, method, or class. In other words, we can say that it
a class without the name and can have only one object that is created by
its definition. Consider the following example.

abstract class Person {

> abstract void eat();

}

class TestAnonymousInner {

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > Person p = new Person() {

> > > void eat() {

> > > > System.out.println(\"nice fruits\");

> > > }

> > };

> > p.eat();

> }

}

Output:

nice fruits

Consider the following example for the working of the anonymous class
using interface.

interface Eatable {

> void eat();

}

class TestAnnonymousInner1 {

> public static void main(String args\[\]) {

> > Eatable e = new Eatable() {

> > > public void eat() {

> > > > System.out.println(\"nice fruits\");

> > > }

> > };

> > e.eat();

> }

}

Output:

nice fruits
