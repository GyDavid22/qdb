This is one of the tricky Java multi-threading questions you will see in
senior Java developer Interview. Yes, you can make an array volatile in
Java but only the reference which is pointing to an array, not the whole
array. What I mean, if one thread changes the reference variable to
points to another array, that will provide a volatile guarantee, but if
multiple threads are changing individual array elements they won't be
having happens before guarantee provided by the volatile modifier.
