hashCode() method returns an int hash value corresponding to an object.
It's used in hash based collection classes e.g Hashtable, HashMap,
LinkedHashMap and so on. It's very tightly related to equals() method.
According to Java specification, two objects which are equal to each
other using equals() method must have same hash code.
