If you are using the programming IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans, MyEclipse,
etc. click on file-\>new-\>project and eclipse will ask you to enter the
name of the package. It will create the project package containing
various directories such as src, etc. If you are using an editor like
notepad for java programming, use the following steps to create the
package.

- Define a package package_name. Create the class with the name
  class_name and save this file with your_class_name.java.

- Now compile the file by running the following command on the
  terminal.

javac -d . your_class_name.java

The above command creates the package with the name package_name in the
present working directory.

- Now, run the class file by using the absolute class file name, like
  following.

java package_name.class_name
