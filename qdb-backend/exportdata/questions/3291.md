Beans are objects that form the backbone of a Spring application. They
are managed by the Spring IoC container. In other words, a bean is an
object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC
container.

There are five Scopes defined in Spring beans.

- Singleton: Only one instance of the bean will be created for each
  container. This is the default scope for the spring beans. While
  using this scope, make sure spring bean doesn't have shared instance
  variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues
  because it's not thread-safe.

- Prototype: A new instance will be created every time the bean is
  requested.

- Request: This is same as prototype scope, however it's meant to be
  used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be
  created for each HTTP request.

- Session: A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the
  container.

- Global-session: This is used to create global session beans for
  Portlet applications.
