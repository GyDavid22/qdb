The following example code shows how to use the Scanner class to read
the file contents line by line and then use the String contains() method
to check if the string is present in the file:

boolean findStringInFile(String filePath, String str) throws
FileNotFoundException {

> File file = new File(filePath);

> Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);

> // read the file line by line

> while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {

> > String line = scanner.nextLine();

> > if (line.contains(str)) {

> > > scanner.close();

> > > return true;

> > }

> }

> scanner.close();

> return false;

}

Note that the example code assumes that the string that you're searching
for in the file doesn't contain newline characters.
