An abstract class in Java is a class that can't be instantiated. Such a
class is typically used for providing a base for subclasses to extend as
well as implementing the abstract methods and overriding or using the
implemented methods defined in the abstract class.

To create an abstract class, it needs to be followed by the abstract
keyword. Any abstract class can have both abstract as well as
non-abstract methods. A method in Java that only has the declaration and
not implementation is known as an abstract method. Also, an abstract
method name is followed by the abstract keyword. Any concrete subclass
that extends the abstract class must provide an implementation for
abstract methods.
