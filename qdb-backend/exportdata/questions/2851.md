First Approach: Set the object references to null once the object
creation purpose is served.

public class IBGarbageCollect {

public static void main (String \[\] args){

> String s1 = \"Some String\";

> > // s1 referencing String object - not yet eligible for GC

> s1 = null; // now s1 is eligible for GC

}

}

Second Approach: Point the reference variable to another object. Doing
this, the object which the reference variable was referencing before
becomes eligible for GC.

public class IBGarbageCollect {

public static void main(String \[\] args){

> String s1 = \"To Garbage Collect\";

> String s2 = \"Another Object\";

> System.out.println(s1); // s1 is not yet eligible for GC

> s1 = s2; // Point s1 to other object pointed by s2

> /\* Here, the string object having the content \"To Garbage Collect\"
> is not referred by any reference variable. Therefore, it is eligible for
> GC \*/

}

}

Third Approach: Island of Isolation Approach: When 2 reference variables
pointing to instances of the same class, and these variables refer to
only each other and the objects pointed by these 2 variables don't have
any other references, then it is said to have formed an "Island of
Isolation" and these 2 objects are eligible for GC.

public class IBGarbageCollect {

IBGarbageCollect ib;>

public static void main(String \[\] str){

> IBGarbageCollect ibgc1 = new IBGarbageCollect();

> IBGarbageCollect ibgc2 = new IBGarbageCollect();

> ibgc1.ib = ibgc2; //ibgc1 points to ibgc2

> ibgc2.ib = ibgc1; //ibgc2 points to ibgc1

> ibgc1 = null;

> ibgc2 = null;

> /\*

> \* We see that ibgc1 and ibgc2 objects refer

> \* to only each other and have no valid

> \* references- these 2 objects for island of isolcation - eligible
> for GC

> \*/
