No, Swing is not thread-safe. You cannot update Swing components e.g.
JTable, JList or JPanel from any thread, in fact, they must be updated
from GUI or AWT thread. That's why swings provide invokeAndWait() and
invokeLater() method to request GUI update from any other threads.

This methods put update request in AWT threads queue and can wait till
update or return immediately for an asynchronous update.
