Object-relational mapping or ORM is the programming technique to map
application domain model objects to the relational database tables.
Hibernate is Java-based ORM tool that provides a framework for mapping
application domain objects to the relational database tables and vice
versa.

Hibernate provides a reference implementation of Java Persistence API,
that makes it a great choice as ORM tool with benefits of loose
coupling. We can use the Hibernate persistence API for CRUD operations.
Hibernate framework provide option to map plain old java objects to
traditional database tables with the use of JPA annotations as well as
XML based configuration.

Similarly, hibernate configurations are flexible and can be done from
XML configuration file as well as programmatically.
