In Java, a string is basically immutable i.e. it cannot be modified.
After its declaration, it continues to stay in the string pool as long
as it is not removed in the form of garbage. In other words, a string
resides in the heap section of the memory for an unregulated and
unspecified time interval after string value processing is executed.

As a result, vital information can be stolen for pursuing harmful
activities by hackers if a memory dump is illegally accessed by them.
Such risks can be eliminated by using mutable objects or structures like
character arrays for storing any variable. After the work of the
character array variable is done, the variable can be configured to
blank at the same instant. Consequently, it helps in saving heap memory
and also gives no chance to the hackers to extract vital data.
