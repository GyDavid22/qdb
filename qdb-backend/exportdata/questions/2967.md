"bit" would have been the result printed if the letters were used in
double-quotes (or the string literals). But the question has the
character literals (single quotes) being used which is why concatenation
wouldn't occur. The corresponding ASCII values of each character would
be added and the result of that sum would be printed.

The ASCII values of 'b', 'i', 't' are:

- 'b' = 98

- 'i' = 105

- 't' = 116

98 + 105 + 116 = 319

Hence 319 would be printed
