Explanation

There are two methods defined with the same name, i.e., sum. The first
method accepts the integer and long type whereas the second method
accepts long and the integer type. The parameter passed that are a = 20,
b = 20. We can not tell that which method will be called as there is no
clear differentiation mentioned between integer literal and long
literal. This is the case of ambiguity. Therefore, the compiler will
throw an error.
