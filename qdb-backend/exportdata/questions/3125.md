The autoboxing is the process of converting primitive data type to the
corresponding wrapper class object, eg., int to Integer. The unboxing is
the process of converting wrapper class object to primitive data type.
For eg., integer to int. Unboxing and autoboxing occur automatically in
Java. However, we can externally convert one into another by using the
methods like valueOf() or xxxValue().

It can occur whenever a wrapper class object is expected, and primitive
data type is provided or vice versa.

- Adding primitive types into Collection like ArrayList in Java.

- Creating an instance of parameterized classes ,e.g., ThreadLocal
  which expect Type.

- Java automatically converts primitive to object whenever one is
  required and another is provided in the method calling.

- When a primitive type is assigned to an object type.
