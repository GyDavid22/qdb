- The super keyword is used to access hidden fields and overridden
  methods or attributes of the parent class.

- Following are the cases when this keyword can be used:

- Accessing data members of parent class when the member names of
  the class and its child subclasses are same.

- To call the default and parameterized constructor of the parent
  class inside the child class.

- Accessing the parent class methods when the child classes have
  overridden them.
