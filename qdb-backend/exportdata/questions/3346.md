Serialization is the process by which Java objects are converted into
the byte stream.

Deserialization is the exact opposite process of serialization where
Java objects are retrieved from the byte stream.

A Java object is serialized by writing it to an ObjectOutputStream and
deserialized by reading it from an ObjectInputStream.
