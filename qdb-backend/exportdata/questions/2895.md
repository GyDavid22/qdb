JCA (Java Cryptography Architecture) in Java is a framework that
provides a platform and a set of architecture and application
programming interfaces (APIs) for implementing encryption and decryption
operations. Developers use JCA to integrate security features into their
applications. It facilitates the incorporation of third-party security
protocols and compliance with various security regulations.

JCA utilizes cryptographic techniques such as hash tables and encryption
message digests to enhance the security of Java applications.
