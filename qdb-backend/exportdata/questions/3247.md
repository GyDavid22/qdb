The benefits of using PreparedStatement over Statement interface is
given below.

- The PreparedStatement performs faster as compare to Statement
  because the Statement needs to be compiled everytime we run the code
  whereas the PreparedStatement compiled once and then execute only on
  runtime.

- PreparedStatement can execute Parameterized query whereas Statement
  can only run static queries.

- The query used in PreparedStatement is appeared to be similar every
  time. Therefore, the database can reuse the previous access plan
  whereas, Statement inline the parameters into the String, therefore,
  the query doesn't appear to be same everytime which prevents cache
  reusage.
