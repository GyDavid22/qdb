Here are couple of best practices I follow while using Collection
classes from Java:

- Always use the right collection e.g. if you need non-synchronized
  list then use ArrayList and not Vector.

- Prefer concurrent collection over synchronized collection because
  they are more scalable.

- Always use interface to a represent and access a collection e.g. use
  List to store ArrayList, Map to store HashMap and so on.

- Use iterator to loop over collection.

- Always use generics with collection.
